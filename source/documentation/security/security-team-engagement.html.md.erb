This guide aims to provide a clear understanding of how to engage with the Cloud Platform team on security-related topics, especially when dealing with sensitive information or implementation details not suitable for public visibility.

We aim to ensure that all security concerns are addressed efficiently and confidentially.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you have identified a security issue that involves sensitive information or implementation details not appropriate for public repositories, please use our dedicated private [cloud-platform-security-issues repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-security-issues) to report it securely.

Please use the provided issue template when reporting security issues. Issues are automatically added to the Cloud Platforms backlog.
