#### Command Line Kubernetes Interaction

Kubernetes has it's own official CLI tool for interacting with a Cluster called `kubectl`. It is certainly worth learning the basics of `kubectl`, As the vast majority of time interacting with Kubernetes will be through this tool.

We have our own page on [Kubectl Basics](/archive.html#kubectl-quick-reference).
