## Slack Channel

The quickest way to get help is to post a question in the
[#ask-cloud-platform] Slack channel.

## Raise a support ticket

You can [raise a support ticket][support-ticket] as an issue
on our GitHub repository.

## Open (half) Hours

If you want to discuss anything relating to the cloud platform, whether that's
learning about general concepts or digging into specific questions, you can
book a slot to discuss your issues with a member of the Cloud Platform team.

Sessions are open to anyone, and can cover any topic related to the Cloud
Platform.

To book a 30 minute slot, please post to [#ask-cloud-platform]

## Onboarding/Migration to the Cloud Platform

We believe that everything you need to start using the Cloud Platform can be found in this user guide.

However, we appreciate that this can be a daunting task, and the Cloud Platform Team is more than happy to spend time with you on planning your journey to the Cloud Platform. This will enable us to improve the onboarding process.

We can also help you determine [how to host your service] and whether the Cloud Platform is the right option for you.
