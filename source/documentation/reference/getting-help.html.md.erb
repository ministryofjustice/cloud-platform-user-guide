# Getting Help

## Slack Channel

The quickest way to get help is to post a question in the
[#ask-cloud-platform] Slack channel.

## Raise a support ticket

You can [raise a support ticket][support-ticket] as an issue
on our GitHub repository.

## Open Hours

We run a weekly "Open Hour (and a half)" every Friday afternoon.

These are sessions in which you can discuss anything relating to the cloud
platform, whether that's learning about general concepts or digging into
specific questions.

Sessions are open to anyone, regardless of location. If you're in 102 Petty
France we can meet in person, if not we're happy to have a video call.

To book a 30 minute slot, please post to [#ask-cloud-platform]
