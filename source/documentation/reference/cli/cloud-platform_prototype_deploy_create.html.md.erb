## cloud-platform prototype deploy create

Create the deployment files and github actions required to deploy in Cloud Platform

### Synopsis


	Create the deployment files and github actions required to deploy the Prototype kit from a github repository in Cloud Platform.

The files will be generated based on where the current local branch of the prototype github repository is pointed to:

  https://[namespace name]-[branch-name].apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk

A continuous deployment workflow will be created in the github repository such
