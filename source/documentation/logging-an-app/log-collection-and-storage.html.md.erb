### Overview

The Cloud Platform automatically collects and stores your application logs, and lets you access them via an AWS-Hosted [Kibana dashboard].

Logs are collected via [Fluentbit], and stored in an AWS-Hosted [ElasticSearch Cluster].

### Log Collection

Fluentbit is a cluster-wide log collection service, with read permissions across the whole cluster. As long as your application logs to `stdout`, your logs will be collected.

### Log Storage

The logs are shipped to an AWS-Hosted ElasticSearch cluster. All application logs are retained for 30 days.
