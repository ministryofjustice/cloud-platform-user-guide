To use the Ministry of Justice's Cloud Platform, you need to connect to the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster.

This guide will take you through installing and configuring `kubectl`. `kubectl` is the official command line tool for Kubernetes.

Once installed and configured, you can use `kubectl` to deploy and manage your applications on the Cloud Platform, in addition to the [Cloud Platform CLI](/documentation/getting-started/cloud-platform-cli.html).

## Installing `kubectl`

>You should install a version of `kubectl` that is within one minor version of the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster.

The Cloud Platform's current [Kubernetes cluster version is 1.28](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/aws-accounts/cloud-platform-aws/vpc/eks/cluster.tf#L37-L42).
Therefore, you should install `kubectl` version 1.27, 1.28, or 1.29.

There is official documentation on how to install `kubectl`, including how to install a specific version:

- [Install kubectl on Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
- [Install kubectl on macOS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/)
- [Install kubectl on Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)

## Authenticating with the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster

Once you've [installed `kubectl`](#installing-kubectl), you will need to authenticate with the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster.

You will need to:

- be part of the `ministryofjustice` GitHub organisation
- be part of the correct GitHub team(s) for your service

### Joining the GitHub organisation

If you have a `@digital.justice.gov.uk` or `@justice.gov.uk` email address and only require access to the `ministryofjustice` Organisation, you can simply join via [SSO](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/sso) to join.
For more information, please refer to the [Operations Engineering user guide](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/mojgithubenterprise.html).

For any issues using the [Join GitHub](https://join-github.service.justice.gov.uk/) service, please contact [#ask-operations-engineering](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4)

### Joining the correct GitHub teams

You can find the correct GitHub team(s) to join by:

- finding your service's namespace in [`cloud-platform-environments`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk)
- in your namespace directory, view the `01-rbac.yaml` file
- there will be at the least one `subject` of `kind: Group`, whose `name` is the GitHub team you need to join, ie:

```
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: "github:my-awesome-team"
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
- ask your team to add you to the listed GitHub team(s)

### Generating a kubeconfig file

To access the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster through `kubectl`, you will need to generate a `kubeconfig` file.

The `kubeconfig` file stores an authentication token for Kubernetes clusters.

To generate a `kubeconfig` file for the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster:

1. Browse to the [login URL for the Cloud Platform](https://login.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/)
2. Select "Continue with GitHub"
3. Login to GitHub (if you're not already logged in)
4. Authorise the "MOJ Cloud Platforms Auth0 (prod)" application in GitHub
    ![GitHub Authorize MoJ](/images/github-authorize-moj-new.png)
5. Accept `live:kubernetes` requesting access to your justice-cloud-platform account
6. Select "Download config file"

> **Note:** 
There can be a delay of a few seconds before the config file is populated with your credentials and ready to download. You can verify that it is ready by taking a look at the code block in the "Authenticate Manually" section on the Kuberos webpage. If the code block is populated with your credentials, and not listing `undefined` for each field, then the config file is ready to download.

7. Move the config file to the location expected by kubectl: `~/.kube/config`:

    ```sh
    $ mkdir ~/.kube
    $ mv ~/Downloads/kubecfg.yaml ~/.kube/config
    ```

8. Reduce the permissions on the file by running:

    ```sh
    $ chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
    ```

9. Tell `kubectl` to use this configuration by running:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl config use-context live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    ```

10. Verify the configuration file by running:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl get namespaces
    ```

    Your output should be similar to:

    ```
    NAME                                              STATUS   AGE
    abundant-namespace-dev                            Active   100d
    ...
    ```

#### Troubleshooting: "current" context

If you see an error like this when executing `kubectl` commands:

```bash
The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused
```

A common reason for this is that the "current" context has not been set. Check it by running:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

If current context is set correctly, you'll see a `*`, like this:

```bash
CURRENT   NAME                                         CLUSTER                                      AUTHINFO                 NAMESPACE
*         live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk   live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk   <your github e-mail>
```

If the `*` is missing, then you need to set the context with the `use-context` command mentioned above.

### Using multiple kubeconfigs

You can have two kubeconfig files, corresponding to different clusters, which is useful when working on multiple clusters. This is a guide to being able to manage multiple kubeconfigs, so you can conveniently switch the cluster that kubectl connects to.

Essentially we will [merge the kubeconfigs into a single file][kubectl-merge], and use `kubectl config use-context` to switch between them.

1. Assuming you already have a kubeconfig for a test cluster, download another kubeconfig for live from [login.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk][authenticate-to-live-cluster].

2. Move the kubeconfig to your .kube folder:

    ```bash
    mv ~/Downloads/kubecfg.yaml ~/.kube/config-live
    ```

3. Edit `~/.kube/config-live`, and change the username **in two places**, from `<firstname>.<lastname>@digital.justice.gov.uk` to `<firstname>.<lastname>@live`, as shown below:

    ```yaml
    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
        user: <firstname>.<lastname>@live
    name: live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    current-context: ""
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
    - name: <firstname>.<lastname>@live
    ```

    Explanation: If we don't rename the username, then the merge will overwrite one of the them and their token, which is different between the clusters.

4. Copy your existing test cluster credentials into a separate file:

    ```bash
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config-test
    ```

5. Edit `~/.kube/config-test`, and change the username in two places, from `<firstname>.<lastname>@digital.justice.gov.uk` to `<firstname>.<lastname>@test`, as shown below:

    ```yaml
    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: test.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
        user: <firstname>.<lastname>@test
    name: test.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    current-context: ""
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
    - name: <firstname>.<lastname>@test
    ```

6. [Merge][kubectl-merge] the two config files together into a new config file and replace your old config with the new merged config:

    ```bash
    KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-test:~/.kube/config-live kubectl config view --flatten > /tmp/config && mv /tmp/config ~/.kube/config
    ```

Now using the single config file, you can switch between test and live context

For test:

```bash
kubectl config use-context test.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

For live:

```bash
kubectl config use-context live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

## Where to go from here?

Now that you've setup `kubectl`, you might want to look at this handy [cheatsheet][kubectl-cheatsheet].

Once you are ready to deploy applications you will need to [create a namespace] first.
