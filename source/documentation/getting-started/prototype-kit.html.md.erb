You can share prototypes made with the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit] by publishing them on the web using an MoJ service called Cloud Platform.

**Note - This process can only be used to deploy prototypes based on the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit]. This process will not work for any other types of apps e.g. Design History. If in any doubt please contact #ask-cloud-platform, or speak to your development team before you follow these instructions.**

## Before you start

To publish a prototype you'll need to:

* be a member of at least one GitHub team in the [MoJ GitHub Organisation]
* have the [Cloud Platform CLI] installed
* have a local development environment including a terminal and a [git client]/[github desktop]

### Assumptions

We assume you will have:

* a github repository in the [MoJ GitHub Organisation], with Gov.UK Prototype Kit code.
* a latest prototype kit code build using Node.js.

## 1. Copy (Clone) the `environments` repository

To create resources on the Cloud Platform, you need to raise a pull request
against the [cloud-platform-environments] repository.

Create a copy of the [cloud-platform-environments] repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments.git
$ cd cloud-platform-environments
```

## 2. Create your prototype kit environment

In the Cloud Platform CLI run:

```bash
$ cloud-platform environment prototype create
```

You'll now be asked to provide some information for your prototype environment. The first prompt you'll see is:

```
Please choose a hostname for your prototype.
This must consist only of lower-case letters, digits and
dashes.
```

>**Note:** It is crucial that the hostname you provide matches the **_name of your prototype github repository_**, and that it **_does not clash with another namespace in the [cloud-platform-environments] repository_**. 

This hostname value will be used as:

* the [namespace] which will be created on the Cloud Platform
* your prototype github repository name, to push the secrets required to access Cloud Platform from your github repository
* the domain name your prototype kit will be published to

For example, if you choose `my-prototype` as the name, the CLI will create:

* a namespace on the Cloud Platform called `my-prototype`
* configure your prototype github repository to create a hostname:

```
 https://my-prototype-main.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/
```

## 3. Raise a PR

After you have answered all the questions, the cloud-platform CLI will create
several files in a folder called:

```
namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/[name you chose]
```

Create a new branch and add/commit the new folder to Git:

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-prototype
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added my-prototype prototype"
```

Push this branch to GitHub:

```bash
$ git push origin my-prototype
```

> Note: Please replace `my-prototype` in the commands above with the name you chose.

And then raise a pull request (PR) by following the instructions that
will appear on GitHub in the [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments)
repository.

Once a member of the Cloud Platform team has approved your PR, merge it.

When you merge the PR, the [Apply Pipeline](/documentation/other-topics/concourse-pipelines.html)
will create your namespace and push the credentials required to publish the kit as github secrets in your GitHub repository.

## 4. Create your prototype kit deployment files

Create a copy of your prototype kit repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/<your-prototype-repository>.git
$ cd <your-prototype-repository>
$ git checkout main
$ cloud-platform prototype deploy create
```

This will create the files to build and deploy your prototype kit to the environment you created in step 2 and 3.

> The deployment files work only on the **latest version** of the prototype kit which we regularly update in the [moj-prototype-template]. Your deployment
may break if your prototype kit is not the latest version.

Use the instructions to [update your prototype kit] to latest version

## 5. Push these files to github

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add docker build and deployment files"
$ git push origin main
```

If you don't have permissions to push directly to the main/default branch, create a branch and raise PR to have it approved and merge.

Create a new branch and add/commit the files to Git:

```bash
$git checkout -b my-branch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add docker build and deployment files"
$ git push origin my-branch
```

Once these files are pushed to your github repository, the prototype kit will be deployed using the github action that is run by your repository.

Look under "Actions" tab on your github repository UI for the progress of the deployment.

Your prototype will be deployed in the below url:

```
https://<your-prototype-repository>-<main>.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

## 6. Publish prototype kit for changes on a specific branch

The github action file under `./github/workflows` and the continuos deployment filenames are generated based on the git branch you are in.

To generate the files for a specific branch, checkout to the branch and run the same command

For example, if you branch is called `tooling`,

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/<your-prototype-repository>.git
$ cd <your-prototype-repository>
$ git checkout tooling
$ cloud-platform prototype deploy create
```

The files generated for deploying in specific branch are as below:

```
./.github/workflows/cd-tooling.yaml
kubernetes-deploy-tooling.tpl
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
start.sh
```

> The docker build files `Dockerfile,.dockerignore, start.sh` work only on the **latest version** of the prototype kit which we regularly update in the [cloud-platform prototype resources]. Your deployment
may break if your prototype kit is not the latest version.

If you want to skip the docker build files when deploying to a branch, you can add a `--skip-docker-files` flag. For example:

```bash
$ cloud-platform prototype deploy create --skip-docker-files
```

## Branch deployment and cleanup

When you create the deployment files using `step 5` for a branch, they are generated to deploy on that specific branch. If the branch is merged to the
main branch, these deployment files will get merged as well. You can do the cleanup by deleting the files specifically created for that branch.

## Deleting your published prototype

When you no longer need your prototype to be published:

> Note - These steps are to decommission the hosting infrastructure that your prototype is running on. This will **not** delete your prototype source code.

1. raise a PR removing your namespace folder from the
`cloud-platform-environments` repository, and wait for it to be approved by a
member of the Cloud Platform team

2. **immediately before you merge the PR** use the GitHub web interface to
delete your repository

3. merge the PR

Your namespace will be removed from the Cloud Platform.
