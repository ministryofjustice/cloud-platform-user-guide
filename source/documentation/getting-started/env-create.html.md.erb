## Introduction

This is a guide to creating a environment in one of our Kubernetes clusters.

We define an environment as a Kubernetes [namespace]
with some key resources deployed in it. Each Kubernetes namespace creates a
logical separation within our cluster that provides isolation from any other
namespace.

Once you have created an environment you will be able to perform actions using
the `kubectl` tool in the namespace you have created.

## Objective

By the end of this guide you'll have created a Kubernetes namespace ready for
you to [deploy an application][deploy-hello-world] into.

## Create an environment

### Pre-requisites

* Docker
* Git
* You must be a member of the `ministryofjustice` organisation on GitHub

You create an environment by adding the definition of the environment as YAML
files in the following GitHub repository:

[cloud-platform-environments][env-repo]

To create a namespace, clone the repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments.git
$ cd cloud-platform-environments
```

Then, run the script to create your namespace:

```
$ make namespace
```

You will be prompted to provide information about the new namespace, and the
script will create the necessary YAML and Terraform files in the correct
location in the repository.

Please create a new branch, add the new files and raise a pull request. The
cloud platform team need to approve your pull request before you can merge it.
Once you have done this, a build pipeline will create your namespace on the
cluster.

Please create **one PR per namespace** i.e. if you need namespaces `myapp-dev`,
`myapp-staging` and `myapp-prod`, please raise a separate PR for each one. This
makes it a lot easier for the cloud platform team to review your PRs.

> #### Naming
> When creating your environment, please ensure that you comply with our
[guidance on naming things][naming-things-guidance].

> This is particularly important for domain names, but since these often closely
match the namespace name, it's worth choosing a good name at this stage.

This is all you need to do in order to create your namespace.

## Accessing your environments

Once the pipeline has completed you will be able to check that your environment
is available by running:

`$ kubectl get namespaces`

This will return a list of the namespaces within the cluster, and you should
see yours in the list.

You can now run commands in your namespace by appending the `-n` or
`--namespace` flag to `kubectl`. So for instance, to see the pods running in
our `myenv-dev` namespace, we would run:

`$ kubectl get pods -n myenv-dev` or

`$ kubectl get pods --namespace myenv-dev`

## Next steps

[Create an ECR repository][ecr-setup] to push your application docker image to.

Then you can try [deploying an app to Kubernetes manually][deploy-hello-world]
by writing some custom YAML files or [deploying an app with Helm][deploy-helm],
a Kubernetes [package manager](https://helm.sh/).

The remainder of this section we describe in detail the YAML files which define
your namespace, in case you need to alter any values.

## Environment definition files

To set up an environment we create 5 Kubernetes YAML files in the directory for
your namespace:

* [`00-namespace.yaml`](#00-namespace-yaml)
* [`01-rbac.yaml`](#01-rbac-yaml)
* [`02-limitrange.yaml`](#02-limitrange-yaml)
* [`03-resourcequota.yaml`](#03-resourcequota-yaml)
* [`04-networkpolicy.yaml`](#04-networkpolicy-yaml)

These files define key elements of the namespace and restrictions we want to
place on it so that we have security and resource allocation properties. We
will use terraform to create these files from templates. We also describe each
of these files [in more detail below](#00-namespace-yaml) in case you want to
make future changes.

In addition to the Kubernetes configuration files, we create a terraform config
file:

    resources/main.tf

This file defines the standard terraform backend and providers which you will
need when you add terraform modules to create the AWS resources your service
will use (e.g. an [ECR][ecr-setup] for your docker images, [RDS
databases][create-rds], and S3 buckets).

## Namespace resource limits

The amount of resources (i.e. CPU and memory) we allocate to new namespaces, by
default, is deliberately low. When you have worked out how much resource your
application actually needs, please raise a PR to adjust the limits on your
namespace accordingly.

For more information, please see this article on [namespace limits].

## Namespace YAML files

These files define key elements of the namespace and restrictions we want to
place on it so that we have security and resource allocation properties.

### `00-namespace.yaml`

The `00-namespace.yaml` file defines the namespace so that the Kubernetes
cluster knows to create the namespace and what to call it.

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: myapp-dev ### This is where you will define your <servicename-env>
  labels:
    name: myapp-dev ### Also your <servicename-env>
```

The namespace is the your (team's) 'private' part of the cluster. The name of
your namespace must be unique across the whole of the cluster. If you try to
create a new namespace using the name of one which already exists, you will get
an error when you try to apply the generated kubernetes config files (or when
our build pipeline applies them on your behalf).

For 'real' services, this is very unlikely to be a problem - most services have
distinct names, so namespace name conflicts are unlikely. But, if you are
creating a test/dummy namespace in order to learn how the platform works, it's
better to avoid generic names like 'dummy', 'test' or 'example'. Add something
unique (e.g. your name) to minimise the risk of trying to re-use a name by
mistake.

### `01-rbac.yaml`

We will also create a `RoleBinding` resource by adding the `01-rbac.yaml` file.
This will provide us with [access policies] on the namespace we have created in
the cluster.

A role binding resource grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or
set of users. A role can be another resource we can create but in this instance
we will reference a Kubernetes default role `ClusterRole - admin`.

This `RoleBinding` resource references the `ClusterRole - admin` to provide
admin permissions on the namespace to the set of users defined under
`subjects`. In this case, the `<yourTeam>` GitHub group will have admin access
to any resources within the namespace `myapp-dev`.

```YAML
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: myapp-dev-admins  ### Your namespace with `-admin` e.g. `<servicename-env>-admin`
  namespace: myapp-dev ### Your namespace `<servicename-env>`
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: "github:<yourTeam>" ### Make this the name of the GitHub team you want to give access to
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### `02-limitrange.yaml`

As we are working on a shared Kubernetes cluster it is useful to put in place
limits on the resources that each namespace, pod and container can use. This
helps to stop us accidentally entering a situation where one service impacts
the performance of another through using more resources than are available.

The first Kubernetes limit we can use is a [LimitRange] which we define in
`02-limitrange.yaml`.

The LimitRange object specifies two key resource limits on containers,
`defaultRequest` and `default`. `defaultRequest` is the memory and cpu a
container will request on startup. This is what the Kubernetes scheduler uses
to determine whether there is enough space on the cluster to run your
application and what your application will start up with when it is created.
`default` is the limit at which your application will be killed or throttled.

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: limitrange
  namespace: myapp-dev ### Your namespace `<servicename-env>`
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 50m
      memory: 500Mi
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 100Mi
    type: Container
```

### `03-resourcequota.yaml`

The [ResourceQuota] object allows us to set a total limit on the resources
reserved for a namespace. As with the LimitRange, the `requests.cpu` and
`requests.memory` limits set how much the namespace will request on creation.

As you learn more about the behaviour of your applications on Kubernetes you
can change the limits on your namespace.

```YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: namespace-quota
  namespace: myapp-dev ### Your namespace `<servicename-env>`
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: 100m
    requests.memory: 1000Mi
```

### `04-networkpolicy.yaml`

The [NetworkPolicy] object defines how groups of pods are allowed to
communicate with each other and other network endpoints. By default pods are
non-isolated, they accept traffic from any source. We apply a network policy to
restrict where traffic can come from, allowing traffic only from the [ingress
controller] and other pods in your namespace.

```YAML
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: myapp-dev ### Your namespace `<servicename-env>`
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-ingress-controllers
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          component: ingress-controllers
```
