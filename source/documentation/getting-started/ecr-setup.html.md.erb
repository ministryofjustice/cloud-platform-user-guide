## Introduction

This guide will guide you through the creation of an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repository for your application's docker image.

AWS resources are provisioned through the [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/) repository, per environment. Your application might be using multiple namespaces, however you typically only need one image repository and once created in any of them you can copy credentials for it to the others via `kubectl get/create secret`.

### Creating the registry

1. In order to create the ECR Docker registry, git clone the environments repo and create a new branch.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments.git
$ cd cloud-platform-environments
$ git checkout -b add_ecr
```

2. You will need to navigate to your service's directory which is located in the namespaces directory. Create a directory named "resources".

```bash
$ cd namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/$your_service
$ mkdir resources ### make directory called resources
$ cd resources
```

3. Create a terraform file within the resources directory.

```bash
$ vi ecr.tf
```

4. Adapt the definition from the example described in the [cloud-platform-terraform-ecr-credentials module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ecr-credentials/tree/master/examples); make sure you adjust the values of `team_name`, `repo_name` `name` and `namespace` to what is appropriate for your environment.


5. git add, commit and push to your branch.

```bash
$ git add ecr.tf
$ git commit
$ git push
```

6. Once your pull request has been approved and the branches are merged, it will trigger our build pipeline which will apply the Terraform module and create the resources.

For more information about the terraform module being used, please read the documentation [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ecr-credentials).

## Accessing the credentials

The end result will be a [Kubernetes secret] inside your environment, called `example-team-ecr-credentials-output` (or whatever you changed that to); the secret holds IAM access keys to authenticate with the registry and the actual repository URL.

Note: For `example-team-ecr-credentials-output` you should put whatever you used as the value of the `name` property of the `kubernetes_secret` resource in the `ecr.tf` file you created previously.

To retrieve the credentials:

```
kubectl -n <namespace_name> get secret example-team-ecr-credentials-output -o yaml
```

The values in kubernetes secrets are always `base64` encoded so you will have to decode them before you can use them outside kubernetes (inside your namespace, the base64 decoding is handled automatically). This can be done at the command line using the following:

```
echo QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== | base64 --decode; echo
```

## Managing your ECR repository

There is a maximum number of images per repository for Amazon Elastic Container Registry(ECR). If a new image is created and pushed to ECR on every code change, repositories can quickly fill up with new revisions. So it is important to regularly delete images which are no longer required.

You can delete an image with the AWS CLI using this [guide][delete-ecr-image].

You can create [custom-alerts][custom-alerts] to monitor the number of ECR images in your Repository using [Prometheus ecr-metrics][ecr-metrics].

### Setting up CircleCI

In your CircleCI project, go to the settings (the cog icon) and select 'AWS Permissions' from the left hand menu. Fill in the IAM credentials from the kubernetes secret, and CircleCI will be able to pull images from your ECR. For more information please see [the official docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/).

## Next steps

Try [deploying an app][deploy-helm] with [Helm](https://helm.sh/), a Kubernetes package manager, or [deploying manually][deploy-hello-world] by writing some custom YAML files.
