### Overview

This guide explains how to update the mandatory tags for the Terraform AWS provider managed resources in your Cloud Platform environment. This is essential for compliance and resource management of AWS resources.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the Cloud Platform namespace where the resources are located.
- Latest version of the Cloud Platform CLI installed.

### Steps to Update Mandatory AWS Tags

1. **Running the cloud-platform CLI command to update tags:**
    
    Use the following command to update the mandatory AWS tags for your namespace resources:

    ```bash
    cloud-platform environment namespace-tags --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --repo-path /path/to/cloud-platform-environments
    ```

    Replace `namespace1` with the actual namespace you want to update, and `/path/to/cloud-platform-environments` with the path to your Cloud Platform environments repository.

2. **Verify the Update:**

    After running the command, verify that the tags have been updated correctly by checking the resources in your cloud-platform-environments repository.

    Before Update:

    ```bash
    provider "aws" {
        region = "eu-west-2"
    }
    ```

    After Update:

    ```bash
    provider "aws" {
        default_tags {
            tags = {
            business-unit = var.business_unit
            application = var.application
            is-production = var.is_production
            owner = var.team_name
            namespace = var.namespace
            }
        }
        region = "eu-west-2"
    }
    ```

    If there are other tags already present, the script should add the mandatory tags without removing the existing ones. But please ensure they are preserved along with the new mandatory tags.

3. **Commit and Push Changes:**

    Once the tags have been updated successfully, commit, push and create a pull request for the changes for review.
