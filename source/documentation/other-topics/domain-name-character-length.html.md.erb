### Overview

The AWS Route53 documentation provides some [guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html) on length constraints when it comes to domain names.

### Domain Label length

Each domain label (that is, each dot-separated text component of a domain name) may be no more than `63` characters in length. However, Cloud Platform's DNS component currently prepends some
Route53 records with an additional string of `6` characters. 

This means that, for the time being, we have implemented a Kubernetes-level policy which will not permit the creation of an `Ingress` object whose hostname fields contain 
domain labels of length greater than `57` characters.
