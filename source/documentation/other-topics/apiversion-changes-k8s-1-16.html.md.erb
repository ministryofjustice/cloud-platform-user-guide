# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Cloud Platform kubernetes cluster has to be upgraded from **1.15.10** to **1.16.10**.
 
As the Kubernetes API evolves, certain APIs are reorganized/upgraded or removed.
Therefore before the upgrade can take place, a number of deprecated 
APIs have to be removed from the manifests used to create kubernetes resources.

The replacement APIs are already available within the current kubernetes version 1.15.10.

Below are the details of the APIs that have been removed in this release, together with the related replacement APIs that should be used in their place.

It is therefore **mandatory** to update affected manifests with the replacements shown below
before we upgrade the cluster to kubernetes version 1.16.

- All resources under `apps/v1beta1` and `apps/v1beta2` - use `apps/v1` instead
- `daemonsets`, `deployments`, `replicasets` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `apps/v1` instead
- `networkpolicies` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `networking.k8s.io/v1` instead
- `podsecuritypolicies` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `policy/v1beta1` instead
- `ingress` resources will no longer be served from `extensions/v1beta1` in v1.20. - use `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` instead

### Resources deployed using helm charts

If you have used helm version < 2.16.3, then the generated manifests will use the deprecated APIs. 
It is therefore **mandatory** to update the manifest with replacement APIs. 
We also suggest upgrading your helm version to > 2.16.3, ideally to [Helm 3](/documentation/deploying-an-app/app-deploy-helm.html#migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3) so the helm
  manifests are not generated with deprecated APIs.

More detailed changes to kubernetes resources are explained in this [kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/) and 
the [1.16 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md#deprecations-and-removals)

## What to do

We have identified the list of affected resources on all namespaces in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DY4PSZjmXqLcnqww0NetmIjMdw3p0hUqfv_ytJ304j4/edit?usp=sharing)

Please make changes as follows:

 * [If you deployed an application to the Cloud Platform with kubectl](#kubectl)

 * [If you deployed an application to the Cloud Platform with Helm](#helm-deployments)

### kubectl 

#### Deployments

Issue the following command to see if you are using deprecated API versions:

```kubectl describe deployment -n <namespace> | egrep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta2"'```

If there is any output similar to that below, then you must change your manifest.

```

{"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1","kind":"Deployment","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"helloworld-rubyapp","namespace":"dstest"}
```

If your deployment manifest looks similar to this:

<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>extensions/v1beta1</b> 
(or apiVersion: <b>apps/v1beta1</b> or apiVersion: <b>apps/v1beta2</b>)
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: helloworld-rubyapp
        spec:
          containers:
</pre>

Migrate to use the `apps/v1` API version. The main changes are:

 * Change the `apiVersion` to `apps/v1`
 * Add a `spec.selector` entry **if there isn't one already** and use the existing `spec.template.metadata.labels` as the selector

The manifest above, after changes, would look like this:

<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>apps/v1</b>
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      <b>selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: helloworld-rubyapp</b>

    template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: helloworld-rubyapp
        spec:
          containers:
</pre>

To apply your changes:

```kubectl apply --filename <your yaml file> --namespace <namespace>```

Issue the following command again (the list should decrease as you apply your changes):

```kubectl describe deployment -n <namespace> | egrep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta2"'```

#### Ingress

Issue the following command to see if you are using deprecated API versions:

```kubectl describe ingress --namespace <namespace> | grep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"'```

If your Ingress configuration looks similar to this:

<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>extensions/v1beta1</b>
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
    spec:
      .................
</pre>

Migrate to use the networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version. The main changes are:

 * Change the `apiVersion` to `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`

 The Ingress configuration after changes will look like:
<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>networking.k8s.io/v1beta1</b>
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
    spec:
      .................
</pre>

To apply your changes:

```kubectl apply --filename <your ingress yaml file> --namespace <namespace>```

Issue the following command again (the list should decrease as you apply your changes):

```kubectl describe ingress --namespace <namespace> | grep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"'```


See **"Notable changes"** section in the [kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/),
if any other fields in your manifests are affected.

### Helm Deployments

Prerequisite: Install [pluto](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto)

```brew install FairwindsOps/tap/pluto```

You can use this to find out whether your helm templates have any of the deprecated APIs.
 
#### Helm 2

Issue the following command to see if you have applications deployed via Helm 2:

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 2 -n <namespace>  -owide```

Here is an example output of a helm chart in the `cptest` namespace which has deprecated APIs, and the suggested replacement:

```
NAME                                                 NAMESPACE    KIND          VERSION              REPLACEMENT                 DEPRECATED   DEPRECATED IN   REMOVED   REMOVED IN
helloworld/helloworld-rubyapp-ingress                cptest   Ingress      extensions/v1beta1   networking.k8s.io/v1beta1   true         v1.14.0         false     v1.22.0
helloworld/independent-bobcat-helloworld             cptest   Deployment   apps/v1beta2         apps/v1                     true         v1.9.0          true      v1.16.0
```

Update the template manifests in your helm chart repo, making the required changes. 

You can test your source code directly using pluto by running:

```
pluto detect-files -d <DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO SCAN>
```

 Upgrade your local helm version to >v2.16.3, Ideally to [Helm 3](/documentation/deploying-an-app/app-deploy-helm.html#migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3). Check the user guide for more instructions on [migrating to Helm 3](/documentation/deploying-an-app/app-deploy-helm.html#migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3)

 If for any reason you cant upgrade to Helm 3:
 
  - Update your local helm version to minimum v2.16.3
  - Upgrade the tiller version in your namespace to minimum v2.16.3

   ```
   helm init --upgrade --tiller-namespace <namespace>
   ```
- rollout the helm chart changes to the cluster

Once updated issue the following command to check the changes were correctly deployed:

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 2 -n <namespace>  -owide```

The output should say

```
APIVersions were found, but none were deprecated. Try --show-all.
```

#### Helm 3

Issue the following command to see if you have applications deployed via Helm 3:

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 3 -n <namespace>  -owide```

Here is an example output of a helm chart in the `cptest` namespace which has deprecated APIs, and the suggested replacement:

```
NAME                                                 NAMESPACE    KIND          VERSION              REPLACEMENT                 DEPRECATED   DEPRECATED IN   REMOVED   REMOVED IN
helloworld/helloworld-rubyapp-ingress                cptest   Ingress      extensions/v1beta1   networking.k8s.io/v1beta1   true         v1.14.0         false     v1.22.0
helloworld/independent-bobcat-helloworld             cptest   Deployment   apps/v1beta2         apps/v1                     true         v1.9.0          true      v1.16.0
```

Update the template manifests in your helm chart repo with the required changes. 

You can test your source code directly using pluto by running:

```
pluto detect-files -d <DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO SCAN>
```
 
Deploy the helm chart changes to the cluster.

Once updated, use the following command to check the changes were correctly deployed:

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 3 -n <namespace>  -owide```

The output should say:

```
APIVersions were found, but none were deprecated. Try --show-all.
```

**NOTE: If you don't update your manifests to use the latest API versions you will get failures when deploying your applications after we upgrade the cluster to kubernetes 1.16**
