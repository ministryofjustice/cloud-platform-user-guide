## Introduction

The Cloud Platform utilises a [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) cluster to manage the pipelines that control deployment of user environments. This page provides an overview of the pipelines that are most relevant to service teams.

## Environments-live pipeline

The **environments-live pipeline** is the part of Cloud Platform that continuously deploys the [environments repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) into Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster and AWS account. Service teams typically define their Kubernetes namespaces and AWS resources in the environments repo, and the Apply Pipeline is what gets it applied.

> Note: Don't confuse it with the **application pipelines**, which are created and managed by service teams. These deploy the Kubernetes resources which make up the application itself (ie Deployment and Ingress resources. The application in turn relies on the resources created by the Apply namespace changes pipeline - the namespace the application runs in and AWS services that it uses.)

## How it operates

There are two main pipelines to be aware of when raising and merging PRs for the environments repo:

### plan-live

The plan pipeline is triggered when a PR is raised. This plan executes as a required GitHub PR Check, and **should always** be reviewed prior to submitting your PR for review in the `#ask-cloud-platform` Slack channel. 

By following the "Details" link next to the completed check, you can view both the `kubectl` dry-run output for any kubernetes resources changes, and also the output of `terraform plan`:

### Apply-namespace-changes pipeline

The Apply namespace changes pipeline is triggered when a PR on the [environments repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) is merged to `main`. The pipeline deploys any Kubernetes manifest or Terraform resource/module changes to whichever environments were changed in the PR.

Essentially it does:

```sh
kubectl -n your-namespace apply -f *.yaml
cd resources
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Viewing the Apply namespace changes pipeline

You can see the pipeline running in [Concourse's "apply-namespace-changes-live" pipeline](https://concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/teams/main/pipelines/environments-live/jobs/apply-namespace-changes-live)

Usage:

* When the pipeline starts, your PR will receive a comment containing a link to the apply job. If you follow this link, you will be able to follow the apply job as it logs out each step. This is a good habit as it allows you to verify that the resources applied correctly.

`cloud-platform-concourse-bot` comment:
> Your PR is applying in the build: https://concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/teams/main/pipelines/environments-live/jobs/apply-namespace-changes-live/builds/1579

Alternatively you can:

* Sign in using your GitHub identity. (The first time, it takes you to a github.com page where you need to agree to Cloud Platform's Concourse instance being allowed to view your GitHub identity.)
* Select the build corresponding to your PR merge (other people's changes to environments also show up here). The latest build is at the top, but you can also identify yours by the merge commit hash.
* Select `task: apply-namespace-changes` to see the logs where terraform is applied.

### Successes and failures

The colour of the header is green if the job was successful, or red for failure. A failing apply can disrupt other Service Teams who wish to apply their environment changes. So in this case, the Cloud Platform team will work quickly, hopefully with the PR author involved, to resolve or reverse changes, to resolve the failure.

### apply-live pipelines and `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE`

In addition to the PR triggered plan and apply namespace pipelines described above, Cloud Platform also has a set of pipelines that run continuouly against _all namespaces_ in the environments repo. These are the `apply-live` [pipelines](https://concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/teams/main/pipelines/environments-live/jobs/apply-live-a), and their purpose is to ensure that failures or configuration drift in any namespaces are detected early.

In the case that an environments PR passes a plan, but then fails on apply after merging in, the Cloud Platform `concourse-bot` will notify you of the failure, and request an APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE file to be added to your namespace. This ensures that the failing namespace will be skipped in these continuous pipelines and give you notice that some fix PR will be necessary. 

The presence of this file **does not** prevent the apply namespace pipeline from running, and once the failing apply has been mitigated, the file should be removed in a subsequent PR.

## Questions

If you have questions about how the Apply Pipeline runs, ask the team in [#ask-cloud-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/messages/C57UPMZLY/team/U58MLFA0M/).
