### Internet facing services

If your application is accessed over the internet, then you'll need to configure an [ingress resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), making sure you've considered the security implications associated with this.

Cloud Platform offers [four classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#deprecated-annotation) of ingress: `default`, `default-non-prod`, `modsec` and `modsec-non-prod`. 

- `default` utilises the standard NGINX Ingress controller setup and it's [supported configurations](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/basic-configuration/) (production workloads only)
- `default-non-prod` same as above for non-production workloads only
- `modsec` extends the capabilities of your ingress resource to enable ModSecurity Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules (production workloads only)
- `modsec-non-prod` same as modsec, but for non-production workloads only

We split our production and non-production workloads for a 2 main reasons:

1. We can roll out upgrades to the non-production ingress classes first and spot issues early before rolling out to production
1. Production classes are more stable as they experience less [NGINX Reloads](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/how-it-works/#when-a-reload-is-required) because of their isolation from inherently unstable workloads

**We highly encourage users to separate their ingress workloads between production and non-production environments** by using the appropriate ingress class (`default` or `modsec` for production, `default-non-prod` or `modsec-non-prod` for non-production).

We have a detailed guide on ModSecurity and how to configure it [here](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/networking/modsecurity.html#modsecurity-web-application-firewall).

> It is the responsibility of the application team to consider and select the appropriate ingress class for their service. However, Cloud Platform **strongly recommend** that all production services are setup with the `modsec` ingress class for additional security.

Here is an example of an ingress resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  namespace: [namespace]
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-weight: "100"
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/set-identifier: my-ingress-[namespace]-green
spec:
  ingressClassName: default
  rules:
    - host: my-shiny-app.internal.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
      http:
        paths:
        - backend:
            service:
              name: shiny-app-service
              port:
                number: 8080
          path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```

### Changing or migrating the ingress class

If you want to change or migrate the ingress class (for example, from a production class to a non-production class, or vice versa), you can update the `ingressClassName` field in your ingress resource:

```yaml
spec:
  ingressClassName: default-non-prod  # change to the desired class
```

**Please note that changing the ingress class will result in some downtime** as the ingress resource is recreated.

Some teams manage their ingress configuration through a Helm chart, in which case the `ingressClassName` value may be defined as a chart value rather than directly in the manifest. If that is the case, you may want to contact your SRE team for guidance on how to make the change safely.

### Internal cluster-bound services

Often, Cloud Platform applications exist to provide a service to other workload(s) running in the cluster. If this is the case, you can use the internal service address. Your service address is in the format:

```
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

You can query your service using `kubectl -n $namespace describe service $yourservice`.

For guidelines on configuring networking rules for cross-namespace traffic, refer to our [NetWork Policies guide](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/networking/network-policy.html).

### Applications in development

If your application is in development and contains sensitive information or requires authentication but does not have it set up, then adding an ingress may not be a good idea.

### Port Forwarding

Instead of opening up your development application to the world, you can instead use Kubernetes built in port forwarding. This feature forwards the port defined in your service to your local machine:

```
kubectl -n $namespace port-forward 8080:8080
```

This will forward your applications port `8080` to your local machines port `8080`. If you visit `localhost:8080` in your browser, you should see your development application.

A tutorial on using `port-forward` can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/).
