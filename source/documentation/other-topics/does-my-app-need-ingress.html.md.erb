### Applications in development

If your app is in development and contains sensitive information or requires authentication but does not have it set up then adding an ingress may not be a good idea.

### Port Forwarding

Instead of opening up your development application to the world you can instead use Kubernetes built in port forwarding. This feature forwards the port defined in your service to your local machine:

```
kubectl -n $namespace port-forward 8080:8080
```

This will forward your applications port `8080` to your local machines port `8080`. If you visit `localhost:8080` in your browser you should see your development application.

A tutorial on using `port-forward` can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/).
