## IP Whitelisting

### NAT Gateways

Many applications use third-party tools for a variety of reasons, and many of these tools require IP Whitelisting.

The Cloud Platform uses NAT Gateways as its external IP Endpoints.

The IP addresses for the clusters are as follows:

#### Live-0 Cluster
```
52.17.133.167
34.251.93.81
34.247.134.240
```

#### Live-1 Cluster
```
35.178.209.113
3.8.51.207
35.177.252.54
```
