# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Cloud Platform kubernetes cluster has to be upgraded from **1.15.10** to **1.16.10**.
 
When an Kubernetes API evolves, certain APIs are reorganized/upgraded or removed.
Therefore before the upgrade can take place, a number of deprecated 
APIs have to be removed from the manifest used to create kubernetes resources.

The replacement APIs are already available within the current kubernetes version 1.15.10.

Below are the details of the APIs that have been removed in this release, together with the related replacement APIs that should be used in their place.

It is therefore **mandatory** to update the affected manifest with the replacements shown below
before we upgrade the cluster to kubernetes version 1.16.

- All resources under `apps/v1beta1` and `apps/v1beta2` - use `apps/v1` instead
- `daemonsets`, `deployments`, `replicasets` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `apps/v1` instead
- `networkpolicies` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `networking.k8s.io/v1` instead
- `podsecuritypolicies` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `policy/v1beta1` instead
- `ingress` resources will no longer be served from `extensions/v1beta1` in v1.20. - use `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` instead

### Resources deployed using helm chart

  - If you have used helm version < 2.16.3, then the generated manifest would have the deprecated APIs. 
  - It is therefore **mandatory** to update the manifest with replacement APIs. 
  - We also suggest to upgrade your helm version to > 2.16.3, ideally to [Helm 3](/documentation/deploying-an-app/app-deploy-helm.html#migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3) so the helm
  manifest are not generated with deprecated APIs.

More detailed changes to kubernetes resources are explained in this [kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/) and 
the [1.16 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md#deprecations-and-removals)

## What to do

- We have identified the list of affected resources on all namespaces in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DY4PSZjmXqLcnqww0NetmIjMdw3p0hUqfv_ytJ304j4/edit?usp=sharing)

- Please make your changes to the following:

 * [If you deployed an application to the Cloud Platform with kubectl](#kubectl)

 * [If you deployed an application to the Cloud Platform with Helm](#helm-deployments)

### kubectl 

#### Deployments

Issue the following command to see if you are using deprecated API versions:

```kubectl describe deployment -n <namespace> | egrep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta2"'```

If there is any output similar to below, then you must change your manifest.

```

{"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1","kind":"Deployment","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"helloworld-rubyapp","namespace":"dstest"}
```

If you deployment manifest looks similar to below:

<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>extensions/v1beta1</b> 
(or apiVersion: <b>apps/v1beta1</b> or apiVersion: <b>apps/v1beta2</b>)
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: helloworld-rubyapp
        spec:
          containers:
</pre>

Migrate to use the apps/v1 API version. Main changes include

 * Change the `apiVersion` tp `apps/v1`
 * Add `spec.selector` **if one not present** and use the existing `spec.template.metadata.labels` as the selector

The manifest after changes will look like:

<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>apps/v1</b>
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      <b>selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: helloworld-rubyapp</b>

    template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: helloworld-rubyapp
        spec:
          containers:
</pre>

To apply your changes:

```kubectl apply --filename deployment-yaml --namespace <namespace>```

Issue the following command again (the list should decrease as you apply your changes):

```kubectl describe deployment -n <namespace> | egrep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta1"|"apiVersion":"apps/v1beta2"'```

#### Ingress

Issue the following command to see if you are using deprecated API versions:

```kubectl describe ingress --namespace <namespace> | grep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"'```

If you Ingress configuration looks similar to below

<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>extensions/v1beta1</b>
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
    spec:
      .................
</pre>

Migrate to use the networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API version. Main changes include

 * Change the `apiVersion` to `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`


 The Ingress configuration after changes will look like:
<pre>
    apiVersion: <b>networking.k8s.io/v1beta1</b>
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
    spec:
      .................
</pre>

To apply your changes:

```kubectl apply --filename ingress.yaml --namespace <namespace>```

Issue the following command again (the list should decrease as you apply your changes):

```kubectl describe ingress --namespace <namespace> | grep '"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1"'```


See **"Notable changes"** section in the [kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/),
if any other fields in your manifest are affected.

### Helm Deployments

Prerequisite: Install [pluto](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto) to find out whether your helm templates has any of the deprecated APIs.

```brew install FairwindsOps/tap/pluto```

#### Helm 2

Issue the following command to see if you have applications deployed utilising Helm 2

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 2 -n <namespace>  -owide```


Here is an example output of a helm chart in cptest namespace which has deprecated APIs and the suggested replacement.

```
NAME                                                 NAMESPACE    KIND          VERSION              REPLACEMENT                 DEPRECATED   DEPRECATED IN   REMOVED   REMOVED IN
helloworld/helloworld-rubyapp-ingress                cptest   Ingress      extensions/v1beta1   networking.k8s.io/v1beta1   true         v1.14.0         false     v1.22.0
helloworld/independent-bobcat-helloworld             cptest   Deployment   apps/v1beta2         apps/v1                     true         v1.9.0          true      v1.16.0
```

- Update the template manifest in your helm chart repo for the required changes. 
You can test your repo using pluto by running

```
pluto detect-files -d <DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO SCAN>
```
- Upgrade your local helm version to >v2.16.3, Ideally to [Helm 3](/documentation/deploying-an-app/app-deploy-helm.html#migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3). Check the user guide for more instructions on [migrating to Helm 3](/documentation/deploying-an-app/app-deploy-helm.html#migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3)
- If for any reason you cant upgrade to Helm 3,
  - Update your local helm version to minimum v2.16.3

  - Upgrade the tiller version in your namespace to minimum v2.16.3

   ```
   helm init --upgrade --tiller-namespace <namespace>
   ```
- rollout the helm chart changes to the cluster

Once updated issue the following command to check applications correctly deployed. 

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 2 -n <namespace>  -owide```


The output should say

```
APIVersions were found, but none were deprecated. Try --show-all.
```

#### Helm 3

Issue the following command to see if you have applications deployed utilising Helm 3

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 3 -n <namespace>  -owide```


Here is an example output of a helm chart in cptest namespace which has deprecated APIs and the suggested replacement.

```
NAME                                                 NAMESPACE    KIND          VERSION              REPLACEMENT                 DEPRECATED   DEPRECATED IN   REMOVED   REMOVED IN
helloworld/helloworld-rubyapp-ingress                cptest   Ingress      extensions/v1beta1   networking.k8s.io/v1beta1   true         v1.14.0         false     v1.22.0
helloworld/independent-bobcat-helloworld             cptest   Deployment   apps/v1beta2         apps/v1                     true         v1.9.0          true      v1.16.0
```

- Update the template manifest in your helm chart repo for the required changes. 
You can test your repo using pluto by running

```
pluto detect-files -d <DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO SCAN>
```
- rollout the helm chart changes to the cluster

Once updated issue the following command to check applications correctly deployed. 

```pluto detect-helm --helm-version 3 -n <namespace>  -owide```

The output should say

```
APIVersions were found, but none were deprecated. Try --show-all.
```

**NOTE: If you dont update your manifest to use the latest API versions after we upgraded to kubernetes 1.16, 
you will get failures when deploying your application.**
