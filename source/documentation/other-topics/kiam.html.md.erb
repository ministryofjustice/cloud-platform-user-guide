## Overview

To avoid having to use AWS access keys to access your AWS service via the Cloud Platform, it is possible to assume a role.

The Cloud Platform uses a tool calles Kiam to allow Kubernetes pods to assume AWS roles.

This guide assumes:
 - You already have a namespace to run your pods in.
 - The role to be assumed has already been created (Contact the Cloud Platform team if you need one.)

## Annotating your namespace
