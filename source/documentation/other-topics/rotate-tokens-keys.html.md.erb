## Overview

Below is the guidance for rotating the tokens and keys that are set as environment variables for your application container or your automated deployment pipeline. 
This guide covers only secrets provided by the Cloud Platform system (your application may have other secrets too)

### Serviceaccount tokens
  Delete the secrets related to the serviceaccount credentials that are used in automated deployment pipeline like circleCI or github Actions. The secret name mostly start with `circleci-token-XXXX`

    ```bash
    $kubectl get secrets -n <yournamespace>
    circleci-token-XXXXX                                       kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      279d
    default-token-jgtdz                                        kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      279d
    es-snapshot-bucket                                         Opaque                                2      144d
    $
    $kubectl delete secret circleci-token-XXXXX -n <yournamespace>

  After the secret is deleted the replacement secret is generated immediately. Check the age of the newly generated secret to confirm. 
  
  Decode the secret using `cloud-platform decode-secret -n <yournamespace> -s circleci-token-XXXXX` to use it in your deployment pipeline.

### AWS credentials
  [Ask the Cloud Platform team](/documentation/reference/getting-help.html) to rotate the credentials related to AWS resources such as ECR, RDS etc., which have been [created by terraform](/documentation/deploying-an-app/add-aws-resources.html). 
  The team will run the instructions from the runbook [Rotate User AWS Credentials](https://runbooks.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/rotate-user-aws-credentials.html#rotate-user-aws-credentials) to regenerate the AWS credentials. 
  This will recreate the kubernetes-secret in the same name and the values are updated automatically in the `mountPath` which the pod consumes.

### Certificate tls keys

  Delete the secrets related to the certificates that are used to create the [certificate resource][obtain-certicate]. The [secret name][secretName] will be shown in your certificate manifest file.

    ```bash
    $kubectl get secrets -n <yournamespace>
    c100-application-tls-long-domain      kubernetes.io/tls                     2      325d
    c100-application-tls-short-domain     kubernetes.io/tls                     2      325d
    circleci-token-msrhd                  kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      17d
    default-token-pztpp                   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      325d
    $
    $kubectl delete secret c100-application-tls-long-domain -n <yournamespace>

  After the secret is deleted the replacement secret is generated immediately. This will not change the duration of the certificate or the renew process.

  You will receive below error message while the new secret is created, it might incur some service downtime (in tests, deleting a secret of a certificate resulted in approx. 7 seconds downtime)

    ```bash
    SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name 'xxxxxxx.service.justice.gov.uk'
    failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it.
