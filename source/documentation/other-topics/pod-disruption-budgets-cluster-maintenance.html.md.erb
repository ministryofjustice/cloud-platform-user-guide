### Introduction

PodDisruptionBudget(PDB) is a feature which will help you run highly available applications and limit the
disruption to your application during node rollouts and pod rescheduling, such as for upgrades or routine maintenance work on the Kubernetes nodes.

Refer to the kubernetes documentation at [pod disruptions,](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) for detailed explanations.

### Defining PodDisruptionBudget for your application:

You can configure PDB by defining the number or percentage of pods that can go down with `maxUnavailable` and
must stay up with `minAvailable`. PDB applies the budget by using a selector and currently
supports ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, and Deployment.

Example PDB definitions using `minAvailable`

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdp
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app-name
```

If your application is defined with `3 deployment replicas`, then during a node rollout, the cluster
will make sure you have 2 available, hence 1 pod is rescheduled at one time.

### Setting minAvailable to 100% or same as pod number

If your deployment replicas are set to 1 and have a PodDisruptionBudget defined with `minAvailable: 100%` or `minAvailable: 1`,
this will ensure none of your pods will ever be disrupted. This will halt any node rollout process by the Cloud Platform team such as draining a node or doing
a cluster upgrade.

Example PDB definitions using `minAvailable:1`

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: helloworld-pdp
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld-rubyapp
```

Example of deployment for the above PDB

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-rubyapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld-rubyapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld-rubyapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rubyapp
        image: ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 4567
```

### PDB with 100% availability and cluster maintenance operations

The Cloud Platform team runs a recycle-node pipeline on every weekday between 8am and 10am where
the oldest worker node is gracefully replaced. This is to ensure the pods are not stuck around forever in one node
and things like namespace quota and limit range changes have the desired effects and not holding reservations for
the old values.

If you have a deployment set as above with an unreasonable/aggressive PDB, the recycle-node pipeline tries to evict the pod gracefully
from the node, but after several unsuccessful retries, it will evict the pod brutally which may bring downtime to your app.

The team also perform regular kubernetes upgrades to mitigate security vulnerability and to benefit from new features. Hence, ensure
your configuration for replicas and PodDisruptionBudget allow the Cloud Platform team to manage the nodes.
