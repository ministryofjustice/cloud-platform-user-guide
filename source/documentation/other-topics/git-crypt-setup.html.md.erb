We use `git-crypt` to ensure that application secrets are encrypted at rest in git.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [GPG](https://gnupg.org/)
2. Install [git-crypt](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/)
3. Generate a key pair, if you don't have one already. The [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/) is a good reference.
4. Push your public key to a key server: `gpg --send-keys PUBKEYID`
5. Add the pubkey to your GitHub account, again, following [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

### Setup

- If the repository has not been setup before, please follow the [git-crypt documentation](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt##using-git-crypt) to do so.

otherwise,

- Share your `PUBKEYID` with an existing member of your team. They will need to trust your key and add you to the repository (see the section below or git-crypt documentation above).

### Adding gpg key to repo

The user that generated the gpg will need to do the following:

1. Run the following command and find the Key ID of the key you've just generated: `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long`
2. Export the gpg key: `gpg --armor --export --output ./<key id>.gpg <key id>`
3. Send the exported .gpg to the existing member of the team.

The existing member of your team will need to do the following steps:

1. Branch the repo that you want to add the user to.
2. Download the exported gpg key from the user.
3. Import the key: `gpg --import <key id>.gpg`
4. Add the user `git-crypt add-gpg-user <user email address>`
5. `push` the changes and create a PR to merge the branch.

### Usage

Once the above has been setup, update your local repository clone and unlock the secrets:

```
$ git pull
$ git-crypt unlock
```

From this point on, `git-crypt` operates transparently.

You can verify the status of files by using `git-crypt status`.
