# Overview 

Network Policies are used to regulate connectivity between Kubernetes namespaces.  
Every namespace in the cluster has network policies which only allow inbound traffic from the _ingress controllers_ namespace (so that incoming requests can be routed to your web applications).

A network policy allows connection based on `PodSelector` and/or `NamespaceSelector`.  The policy will then filter requests based on namespace or pod labels.

## Namespace Label

This example demonstrates using a `namespaceSelector` to route traffic based on a namespace label.

Any namespace label can be used in the network policy.   
For clarity, and to avoid overlap with other namespaces, let's make our label key:   
   `cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace`


```
# 00-namepace.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: source-namespace
  labels:
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace: "source-namespace"  # this is the label 
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/is-production: "false"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/environment-name: "dev"
  annotations:
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/business-unit: "HMPPS"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/application: "court-probation"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/owner: "andy.marke@digital.justice.gov.uk: andy.marke@digital.justice.gov.uk"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/source-code: "https://github.com/ministryofjustice/court-probation-service"
```


##  Network Policy  

Once the relevant label has been added to the namespace, the policy can be created.   

The policy below allows all traffic from namespaces which have a label called `cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace` with the the value `source-namespace` to route to the namespace called `target-namespace`.

```
# 04-networkpolicy.yaml
# allow-source-namespace.yaml
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-source-namespace
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace: "source-namespace'

```

Note: For more complex use-cases, or if the policy is going to be specific to a Pod, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors)

## Accessing the service

To access a service in the target namespace **from the source namespace** we need to add the target namespace name to the domain name of the service, e.g:

```
curl myservice.target-namespace
```
