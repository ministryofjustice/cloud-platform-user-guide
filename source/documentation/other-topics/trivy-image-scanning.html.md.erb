Cloud Platform uses [Trivy] to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities. It lives inside the cluster and will scan any image that is deployed to it. At this point in time, there is no action required from the user, but it's strongly recommended that you are aware of the following:

- Trivy is a vulnerability scanner, not a vulnerability fixer. It will tell you if there are vulnerabilities in your image, but it will not fix them for you.

- Trivy is a static analysis tool. It will scan your image for vulnerabilities when it is deployed to the cluster, but it will not scan your image for vulnerabilities when you build it. You should run Trivy locally on your image before you deploy it to the cluster.

- Trivy is not a vulnerability database. It will not tell you if a vulnerability has been fixed in a later version of the image. You should check the image's documentation to see if there are any newer versions available.

## How to use Trivy

As Trivy is installed inside the cluster, you can see the results of the scan by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get vuln -n [your namespace]
```

This will return a list of all the images that have been deployed to your namespace and the results of the scan.

If you want to see the results of the scan for a specific image, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe vuln [your image name] -n [your namespace]
```

This will return a list of all the vulnerabilities found in the image, along with the severity of the vulnerability.

You can also see the results of the scan in the [Cloud Platform Grafana Dashboard].

## How to fix vulnerabilities

If you find that your image has vulnerabilities, you should fix them as soon as possible. The best way to do this is to update your image to use a newer version of the software that has the vulnerability.

## How to run Trivy locally

You can run Trivy locally on your image before you deploy it to the cluster. This will give you a list of vulnerabilities that are present in your image, so you can fix them before you deploy it.

To run Trivy locally, you will need to install it on your machine. You can find installation instructions on the [Trivy GitHub page].

Once you have installed Trivy, you can run it on your image by running the following command:

```bash
trivy image [your image name]
```

This will return a list of all the vulnerabilities found in the image, along with the severity of the vulnerability.
