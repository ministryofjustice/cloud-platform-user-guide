# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The `batch/v1beta1` API version of CronJob is deprecated as of Kubernetes release v1.21, and will no longer be served as of v1.25.

Cloud Platform users are encouraged to ensure any CronJob manifests are migrated to use the `batch/v1` API version, which is supported on our current cluster version (v1.22 as of writing).

Further details can be found within the [Kubernetes deprecation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#cronjob-v125)

### Steps required

To view which apiVersion you are using, run the following kubectl command:


`kubectl --namespace <namespace> get cronjob <cronjob-name> -o yaml`


```
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
...
```


You are only required to update `apiVersion` as the following complete example shows:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "1 2-14 * * 0-1,5-6"
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: bitnami/nginx
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo "Hello, World!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
