# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The `batch/v1beta1` API version of CronJob is deprecated as of Kubernetes release v1.21, and will no longer served as of v1.25.

Cloud Platform users must ensure any CronJob manifests are migrated to use the `batch/v1` API version, which is supported on our current cluster version (v1.31 as of writing).

Further details can be found within the [Kubernetes deprecation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#cronjob-v125)

### How to check and replace the deprecated apiVersion

Prerequisite: Install [pluto](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto) to find out whether any of the manifest has any of the deprecated APIs.

```brew install FairwindsOps/tap/pluto```

To check if you are using deprecated apiVersion, run the following command:

`pluto detect-all-in-cluster --namespace <your namespace>`

If there is any deprecated apiVersion of CronJob, the output will look like this:

```bash

test-cronjob            CronJob                   batch/v1beta1         batch/v1         true      true         true
```

For resources deployed using helm chart, the above list shows that the helm manifest deployed has the deprecated API version irrespective of the resource exists in the cluster.

Update `apiVersion` as the following example and apply the manifest:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "1 2-14 * * 0-1,5-6"
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: bitnami/nginx
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo "Hello, World!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Run the following command to check if the manifest is updated:

`pluto detect-all-in-cluster --namespace <your namespace>`
