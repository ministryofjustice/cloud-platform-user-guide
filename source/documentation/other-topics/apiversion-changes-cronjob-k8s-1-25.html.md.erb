# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The <b>batch/v1beta1</b> API version of CronJob is no longer served as of v1.25.

Cloud Platform users must ensure any CronJob manifests are migrated to use the <b>batch/v1</b> API version, which is supported on our current cluster version (v1.24 as of writing).

Further details can be found within the [Kubernetes deprecation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#cronjob-v125)


### How to check and replace the deprecated apiVersion

Prerequisite: Install [pluto](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto) to find out whether any of the manifest has any of the deprecated APIs.

```brew install FairwindsOps/tap/pluto```


To check if you are using deprecated apiVersion, run the following command:

`pluto detect-all-in-cluster --namespace <your namespace>`

If there is any deprecated apiVersion of HorizontalPodAutoscaler, the output will look like this:

```bash

```

For resources deployed using helm chart, the above list shows that the helm manifest deployed has the deprecated API version irrespective of the resource exists in the cluster. 

Update `apiVersion` as the following example and apply the manifest:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "1 2-14 * * 0-1,5-6"
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: bitnami/nginx
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo "Hello, World!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
