[Prometheus] collects metrics data on RDS instances via the [CloudWatch Exporter].

The available metrics are listed [here][metrics list].

You can view any of these metrics as a graph using the [Prometheus UI] by writing it as an expression like this:

```
aws_rds_free_storage_space_average{dbinstance_identifier="<YOUR DATABASE IDENTIFIER>"}
```

Put your expression into the `Expression` text field, then click the `Execute` button and view the `Graph` tab.

Your database identifier is available from the kubernetes secret or configmap, which was created with your RDS instance.
The string you want is the hostname part of your RDS instance address. So, if your RDS instance address is:

```
cloud-platform-ab10ab10ab10ab10.cdwm11111111.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
```

Then your database identifier for the Prometheus expression is:

```
cloud-platform-ab10ab10ab10ab10
```

And the full expression would be:

```
aws_rds_free_storage_space_average{dbinstance_identifier="cloud-platform-ab10ab10ab10ab10"}
```

You can use the various graph controls to adjust the time period and resolution of your graph.
