### Overview

Alertmanager allows you define your own alert conditions based on the [Prometheus expression language](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics) expressions.

The aim of this document is to cover the specifics of setting up alerting for RDS.

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:

* You have created a namespace for your application
* You have an RDS instance defined in that namespace
* You are already familiar with creating custom alerts, as explained [here](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/monitoring-an-app/how-to-create-alarms.html#creating-your-own-custom-alerts)
* You know the RDS database identifier you want to monitor (which can be found in the RDS kubernetes secret in your namespace)

### RDS metrics

Prometheus gathers and exposes a few RDS metrics. Here is the full list:

```
aws_rds_cpuutilization_average
aws_rds_database_connections_average
aws_rds_free_storage_space_average
aws_rds_free_storage_space_minimum
aws_rds_free_storage_space_maximum
aws_rds_freeable_memory_average
aws_rds_read_iops_average
aws_rds_read_latency_average
aws_rds_write_iops_average
aws_rds_write_latency_average
```

### An example

This is an example of a PrometheusRule that triggers an alert if the amount of free space of an RDS instance drops below 1Gb:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  namespace: <namespace>
  labels:
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-custom-rules-<application_name>
spec:
  groups:
  - name: application-rules
    rules:
    - alert: RDSLowStorage
        expr: aws_rds_free_storage_space_average{dbinstance_identifier="<YOUR_DB_ID"} offset 10m < 1000000000
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: <SEVERITY>
        annotations:
          message: "[{{ environment|upper }}] RDS free storage space is less than 1GB"
```

- Run

After creating a YAML file containing your prometheus rule, you can apply it like this:

```
kubectl apply -f prometheus-custom-rules-<application_name>.yaml -n <namespace>
```

> We recommend keeping your prometheus rule definitions in your namespace folder in the [environments repository]. This ensures that your rules will be recreated in the event that we ever need to reinstall prometheus.
