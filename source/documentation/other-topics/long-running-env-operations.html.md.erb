Some operations on namespaces in the Cloud Platform can take a long time to
complete, e.g. upgrading an RDS instance from one version to another.

This means a scheduled [apply pipeline] run might try to operate on a namespace
while it is being modified.

We use [Terraform state locking] to ensure that this does not cause serious
problems, but at the least it would cause the [Apply Pipeline](/documentation/other-topics/apply-pipeline.html)
to timeout with an error if it can't acquire a lock on the target namespace's
terraform state.

For this reason, we have a mechanism to allow the Apply Pipeline to skip
individual namespaces during long-running operations.

To use this feature:

1. Prepare the terraform code change which implements your namespace change.
1. Before raising your PR, include a file called `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` (this file merely has to exist - its contents are irrelevant).

> The file needs to be in the top-level folder for your namespace, e.g:
```
namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/mynamespace/APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE
```

1. Raise your PR, and approve it when it is merged.
1. After your change has completed successfully, raise another PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` file.
