## Overview

Following the announcement of the [CircleCI Security Alert](https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/) issued 04/01/2023, the Cloud Platform
team has been focusing on working to ensure that all secrets impacted by this event have been rotated.

### Is my Cloud Platform namespace affected?

As part of our investigation into this incident, we have identified a number of namespaces which require AWS secrets to be rotated. Prior to
commencing the rotation work, we will be sending out comms in the `cloud-platform-update` and `ask-cloud-platform`
Slack channels. These comms will contain a list of all affected namespaces.

### Impacted Services

#### Cloud Platform Terraform Modules

If your Cloud Platform workload utilises any of the following Cloud Platform Terraform Modules, AWS Access ID and Secret Access Keys will
be rotated. 

- RDS
- RDS Aurora
- DynamoDB
- S3
- SNS Topic
- SQS
- DMS

ECR Module AWS secrets have already been rotated in a previous activity, so will not be covered
during this process.

#### Non-Module defined AWS Secrets -- ?? Need expanding?

In addition to the above modules, if you have any `iam_user` Terraform resources defined in your namespace, their associated keys will also be rotated. For example,
you may have similar to the following in your `namespace/resources` folder:

```bash
resource "aws_iam_user" "user" {
  name = "s3-bucket-user-${random_id.id.hex}"
  path = "/path/to/iamuser"
}

resource "aws_iam_access_key" "user" {
  user = aws_iam_user.user.name
}

resource "kubernetes_secret" "aws_iam_secret" {
  metadata {
    name      = "s3-bucket"
    namespace = var.namespace
  }

  data = {
    destination_bucket = "s3://${var.namespace}"
    user_arn           = aws_iam_user.user.arn
    access_key_id      = aws_iam_access_key.user.id
    secret_access_key  = aws_iam_access_key.user.secret
  }
}
```
The rotation process will recreate the `aws_iam_access_key` resource and update the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` fields in the `kubernetes_secret`
resource.

### Rotation Process

>NOTE: It is the responsibility of application owners to identify and carry out any remediation activites to update these values
>wherever they are used for their service. It is for this reason that the team has elected to follow a 'user merge' managed approach 
>for triggering the rotation of these secrets.

The Cloud Platform team will raise a PR _*per namespace*_ on your behalf, which you will need to approve for merging. Cloud Platform will then merge the PR, 
triggering a recreation of all AWS secrets within this namespace.

### Steps to follow

>IMPORTANT: As with any service impacting change, we strongly encourage you to carry out thorough testing of this rotation
process within non production environments before proceeding with your production namespaces. The Cloud Platform team has conducted
testing of secrets rotation against all modules and in many scenarios services relying on any of the impacted resources will
immediately fail to work as expected. We recommend that all pods in your namespace are recycled following completing of rotation
PR.

It is advised that before merging the secret rotation PR that you check the values of all of your namespace's AWS secrets. This will
assist in verifying the rotation has completed once applied via our Concourse pipeline. This can be done for each of your Kubernetes secrets
containing AWS secrets as follows:

```bash
$ kubectl  -n <YOUR-NAMESPACE> get secret <AWS-RESOURCE-SECRET>  -o yaml
```

Or use the `cloud-platform decode-secret` CLI command to automatically `base64` decode the values:

```bash
$ cloud-platform decode-secret -n <YOUR-NAMESPACE> -s <AWS-RESOURCE-SECRET>
```
An example of the above command for obtaining RDS Module `secrets` output would be similar to the following:

```bash
$ cloud-platform decode-secret -n my-namespace -s rds-postgresql-instance-output
```
```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "data": {
        "access_key_id": "xxxxxxx",
        "database_name": "db1234567",
        "database_password": "xxxxxxx",
        "database_username": "dbuser",
        "rds_instance_address": "cloud-platform-xxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
        "rds_instance_endpoint": "cloud-platform-xxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432",
        "secret_access_key": "xxxxxxx",
        "url": "postgres://xxxxxxx:xxxxxxx@cloud-platform-xxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/db1234567"
    },
    "kind": "Secret",
    "metadata": {
        "creationTimestamp": "2023-01-11T13:37:38Z",
        "name": "rds-postgresql-instance-output",
        "namespace": "your-namespace",
        "resourceVersion": "11111111",
        "uid": "xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx"
    },
    "type": "Opaque"
}
```

The values being updated here are `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`. You will need to follow a similar process for each 
of your Kubernetes `secrets`.

>NOTE: There are teams which share AWS secrets to other relying namespaces, for example ECR & RDS credentials. This will need to be taken into
>consideration as applications running in these other namespaces will also be impacted.

### How do I know when my secrets rotation has completed?

The secrets rotation process will update existing Kubernetes `secrets` in namespaces rather than replacing them entirely; therefore it
is not possible to rely on checking the age of your `secrets` as this will not change. There are two checks that you can follow to 
confirm rotation has completed:

- Monitoring the Concourse `apply-namespace-changes-live` pipeline for your PR. Each job run in this pipeline outputs the following 
information at the beginning of the `task: apply-namespace-changes` stage:

```
Found PR: [PR number]
Applying Namespace: [namespace being applied]
```
The Concourse pipeline URL will be provided via comms during the rotation process.

- Conducting a "before and after" check of your AWS secrets values using the above `kubectl` or `cloud-platform decode-secret` CLI
commands. Once you have observed these have been updated you are ready to proceed with updating your environment with the new
values.




<!--- RDS PASSWORD ROTATION : NOT FOR NOW.....

### RDS Database Password Rotation



In the coming weeks, we will also be rotating all impacted RDS database passwords as a matter of diligence.
