# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This page describes how to upgrade your RDS database to a new minor or major version, or a different instance class. You might want to do this to bring your application up to date, or if AWS or your database engine provider have announced they'll stop supporting a particular version.

There are two ways to upgrade your RDS database and both require downtime, which will vary based on method, database instance class, and storage size.

> **Important:** `db.t2` instance classes are [previous generation instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/previous-generation/). You should upgrade your instance class to either `db.t3` or `db.t4g` as part of your upgrade.

## Important information to know when upgrading your database

### Engine version upgrades (e.g. PostgreSQL 10 to 12)

- Single-AZ and multi-AZ databases are upgraded by AWS in the same way. A multi-AZ database does not improve downtime for engine version upgrades, as AWS upgrades the primary and standby/replica instances **at the same time** _unless_ you're using SQL Server, where AWS will perform a rolling upgrade. Downtime for this change varies by method, database instance class, storage size, and more.

- AWS provide a list of supported versions to upgrade to for each database engine:
  - [PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.MajorVersion)
  - [MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.MySQL.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.MySQL.Major)
  - [SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.SQLServer.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.SQLServer.Major)

### Database instance class changes (e.g. db.t2 to db.t3)

- A multi-AZ database instance class change will have reduced downtime as AWS will change the standby/replica instance is upgraded first (and promoted to `primary`, followed by the new (old `primary`) standby database. Downtime for this change using a multi-AZ configuration is typically around ~120 seconds.
- You will need to [check your database engine version supports the instance class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#Concepts.DBInstanceClass.Support) you are changing to.

## Upgrading through migration

>Note: This method causes downtime.

Instead of trying to upgrade your existing RDS instance:

* Create a new RDS instance, using the PostgreSQL version you want
* Migrate all your application data
* Change your application configuration (environment variables) to use the new RDS instance
* Delete your olds RDS instance

### Advantages

* Can be done with little or no downtime
* Very predictable
* Easily reversible at any stage

### Disadvantages

* Requires more planning and attention

If you want to use this method, you can treat it like any other [database migration](aws-rds-migration.html) (but easier, because everything is in the same namespace).

## Upgrading in place

>Note: This method causes downtime.

The upgrade process involves these steps:

* Raise and merge a PR to [tell the Apply Pipeline to skip your namespace][long-running]
* Alter your RDS instance to use the default [parameter group] for your **current** PostgreSQL version
* Raise and merge a PR to change your PostgreSQL version to the one you want - the Apply Pipeline will handle the upgrade for you
* Raise another PR to [remove the "skip file"][long-running] from your namespace

### Advantages

* Very easy to do

### Disadvantages

* Incurs some service downtime (in tests, an almost empty database upgrading from PostgreSQL 9.5 to 9.6 resulted in approx. 7 minutes downtime)
* It is possible (although unlikely) that version-specific custom parameters could result in problems you don't see until the upgrade fails

### Procedure

The rest of this page will describe this process in detail.

> If you have any read replicas, AWS will upgrade those as well, as soon as you upgrade the primary RDS instance. You will need to adjust the terraform code which defines your replicas, after the upgrade.

#### Use the AWS CLI to get your existing database configuration

When your RDS instance is created, an IAM user is also created, and the AWS credentials are stored as kubernetes secrets in your namespace.

We will use these credentials with the [AWS CLI tool] to describe and then modify your RDS instance.

##### Get your RDS instance identifier and IAM user credentials

```
kubectl -n [your namespace] get secret
```

This will give you a list of the secrets in your namespace. Identify the RDS
instance secret via its name, and decode its contents using the [cloud platform cli]:

```
cloud-platform decode-secret -n [your namespace] -s [secret name]
```

Here is a redacted example:

```
cloud-platform decode-secret -n dstest -s rds-instance-output

{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "data": {
        "access_key_id": "AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "database_name": "db2axxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "database_password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "database_username": "xxxxxxxxxx",
        "rds_instance_address": "cloud-platform-1111111111111111.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
        "rds_instance_endpoint": "cloud-platform-1111111111111111.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306",
        "secret_access_key": "qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq",
        "url": "postgres://xxxxxxxxxx:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@cloud-platform-1111111111111111.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/db2axxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    },
    "kind": "Secret",
    "metadata": {
        "creationTimestamp": "2020-06-19T13:43:31Z",
        "name": "rds-instance-output",
        "namespace": "dstest",
        "resourceVersion": "276902169",
        "selfLink": "/api/v1/namespaces/poornima-dev/secrets/rds-instance-output",
        "uid": "1f4243d8-ee57-4756-af09-5a8084a89988"
    },
    "type": "Opaque"
}
```

Use the values you see to set the following environment variables:

```
export db=cloud-platform-1111111111111111
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq"
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
```

Now you can get the relevant configuration details of your RDS instance like this:

```
$ aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier $db \
  | jq ".DBInstances[] | {engine: .Engine, version: .EngineVersion, db_parameter_group: .DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName}"

# Output should be something like this:

{
  "engine": "postgres",
  "version": "9.5.22",
  "db_parameter_group": "cloud-platform-cdd5540ee12aa320"
}
```

##### Tell your RDS instance to (temporarily) use the default parameter group

Your RDS instance's existing parameter group is tied to the `db_engine`. e.g. a PostgreSQL 9.5 parameter group cannot be used with a PostgreSQL 9.6 RDS instance. So, the existing parameter group must be deleted, and a new one created when your RDS instance is updated. But, you can't delete a parameter group if it has any RDS instances using it. So, the first step is to remove your RDS instance from its database parameter group.

> If you have configured any specific PostgreSQL settings for your database, such that your application will not work using the default parameter group, you may need to create a new parameter group based on the new PostgreSQL version, and use that instead of the default parameter group here.

This is the list of default parameter groups. Use the one matching the **current** database engine version of your RDS instance:

```
default.aurora-postgresql11
default.aurora-postgresql9.6
default.aurora5.6
default.mariadb10.4
default.mysql5.7
default.postgres10
default.postgres11
default.postgres12
default.postgres13
default.postgres14
default.postgres9.4
default.postgres9.5
default.postgres9.6
```

For example, to change to the default PostgreSQL 9.5 parameter group:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier $db \
  --db-parameter-group-name default.postgres9.5
```

This will output a few screenfuls of JSON, which you can ignore. After making the change, repeat the `describe-db-instances` command to confirm that the change has worked.

> It is important that the Apply Pipeline is paused, at this point, or it will revert the above change, and your upgrade will fail.

##### Upgrade your RDS instance

After your RDS instance has been removed from the existing database parameter group, you can raise a PR in the environments repository to upgrade your RDS instance.

e.g. To upgrade from PostgreSQL 9.5 to 9.6 (this is a [major version upgrade]), you would change your `resources/rds.tf` file like this:

```
-  db_engine_version          = "9.5"
+  db_engine_version          = "9.6"
...
-  rds_family = "postgres9.5"
+  rds_family = "postgres9.6"
```

When this PR is merged, the [Apply Pipeline](/documentation/other-topics/apply-pipeline.html) will upgrade your RDS instance.

> In testing, data in the database was preserved, and the total downtime of the RDS instance was approx. 7 minutes. You need to carry out your own tests in your non-production namespace(s) to confirm that this behaviour is similar and acceptable, for your service.
