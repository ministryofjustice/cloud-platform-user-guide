When you create an RDS instance using the [RDS module], it is created inside a
virtual private cloud (VPC), which will only accept network connections from
within the kubernetes cluster.  So, trying to connect to the RDS instance from
your local machine will not work.

```
+--------------+      outside      \ /       inside           +--------------+
| Your machine | -------------------X-----------------------> | RDS instance |
+--------------+                   / \                        +--------------+
                               VPC Boundary
```

If you need to access your database from outside the cluster (e.g. from your
own development machine, or to perform a bulk data import), you can do so via
the following steps:

1. Run a pod inside the cluster to forward network traffic to your RDS instance
2. Tell kubernetes to forward traffic from your local machine to the new pod
3. Access the database as if it were running on your local machine

So, the connection from your machine to the RDS instance works like this:

```
+--------------+             +---------------------+          +--------------+
| Your machine |------------>| Port forwarding pod |--------->| RDS instance |
+--------------+             +---------------------+          +--------------+
```

### 1. Run a port-forward pod

There are several docker images designed to forward network traffic, but you need one which does not run as `root`. 

> The cluster pod security policy (PSP) will prevent any images from running a process as the `root` user, so docker images which expect to do this will not work.

We will use [ministryofjustice/port-forward][port-forward-image] for this example.

```
kubectl \
  -n [your namespace] \
  run port-forward-pod \
  --generator=run-pod/v1 \
  --image=ministryofjustice/port-forward \
  --port=5432 \
  --env="REMOTE_HOST=[your database hostname]" \
  --env="LOCAL_PORT=5432" \
  --env="REMOTE_PORT=5432"
```

> This creates a pod in your namespace, but without a deployment to manage it.
>
> Manually-created pods (i.e. those which are not part of a [deployment]) block
some cluster operations such as [draining a node] in order to replace it. For
this reason, we have set up an automated process which will **delete any such
pods after 24 hours**. If you need a port-forward pod to persist longer than
this, please make it part of a [deployment].

### 2. Forward local traffic to the port-forward-pod

Now you need to forward network traffic from a port on your local machine to the port-forward pod inside the cluster.

```
kubectl \
  -n [your namespace] \
  port-forward \
  port-forward-pod 5432:5432
```

You need to leave this running as long as you are accessing the database.

### 3. Access the database

Now you can connect to the database as if it were running locally, on your machine.

If you are exporting a database URL from your RDS kubernetes secret, it might have a value like this:

```
postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37

```

You can use this URL to connect to your database via the port forward you have set up, but you need to replace the database hostname, (`cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com` in this example), with `localhost`.

So, if you were starting from the database URL above, the database connection command you will run on your local machine would be:

```
psql postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@localhost:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37
```

If you are exporting the database credentials separately, the command would be something like this:

```
psql \
  --host localhost \
  --port 5432 \
  --dbname [your database name] \
  --username [your database username] \
  --password
```

(You will be prompted to enter the database password, which you should get (and then base64 decode) from your kubernetes secret)

### 4. Delete the port-forward pod

Please remember to delete the port-forwarding pod when you have finished.

```
kubectl delete pod port-forward-pod -n [your namespace]
```
