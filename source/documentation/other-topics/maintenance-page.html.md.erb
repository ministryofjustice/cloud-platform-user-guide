### Overview

This document will serve as a guide on how to apply a default
maintenance page to your application on the Cloud Platform.

### Deploying the page

A repository has been created to store all the files related to the
maintenance page:

[cloud-platform-maintenance-page](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-maintenance-page)

The repository contains the manifest files needed to deploy a
standard maintenance page into your namespace. This directory also
contains the maintenance page HTML file, along with a `Dockerfile`
to build an image to serve the maintenance page.

Within the `kubectl_deploy` directory, there are 2 simple manifest
files that make up the deployment, `maintenance-deploy.yaml` and `maintenance-service.yaml`.

To use this example, deploy the files into your namespace (you may want to create your own docker image, with a customised HTML page, and tweak the yaml files to use that image).

The deployment will create a pod called maintenance-page-* and a service named maintenance-page-svc.

To redirect traffic to your maintenance page, change the `serviceName` field in your **current** ingress
to point to `maintenance-page-svc` and redeploy the ingress. Also, check the `servicePort` matches the one mentioned in the service you want to deploy.

By changing the current ingress you can ensure that you do not incur any downtime.

For more details on customizing the HTML and cleaning up, please refer to the [cloud-platform-maintenance-page](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-maintenance-page) repository.
