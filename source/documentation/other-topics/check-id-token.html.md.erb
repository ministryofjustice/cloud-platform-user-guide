This guide explains how you can confirm that the token in your `~/.kube/config`
file lists the correct github groups.

Inside your `~/.kube/config` file there is an `id-token` value. This token is
the credential that the cluster uses to decide which operations you are
authorised to do.

In particular, the token contains a list of the github groups you are in, and
this is used to grant/block access to specific namespaces in the cluster.

The token is a [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) and you can
check that the correct github groups are listed by decoding it to view the
contents.

> Please do not paste your ID token into an online JWT decoder. Your token is
an important security credential and needs to be kept secret, just like
passwords or AWS keypairs.

The easiest way to check which github groups are listed in your id-token is to
use the [cloud platform CLI] tool. If you have the CLI installed, just run:

```
cloud-platform kubecfg id-token-claims
```

You should see a JSON output similar to this:

```json
...
  "https://k8s.integration.dsd.io/groups": [
    "github:webops",
    "github:technical-architects",
    "github:moj-cjse"
  ],
  "nickname": "digitalronin",
  "name": "David Salgado",
...
```

The groups listed here must include a group specified in you namespace's
`01-rbac.yml` file, in the [environments repository].

If you do not see the github group corresponding to the namespace you are
trying to work on, you will get:

```
Error from server (Forbidden)...
```

...when you try to run commands using `kubectl`.
