## Kubernetes

The MoJ Digital Cloud Platform is based on [Kubernetes][] (aka **"k8s"**, because it's much shorter).

### Resources

Here are some links to introductory Kubernetes resources:

 * For a brief and light-hearted introduction to what Kubernetes is all about, try this [comic][k8s-comic] from Google.
 * [Concept video][k8s-video]
 * [Ingress][]. This is an important concept which is not covered in the official introduction document.
 * [Pluralsight k8s course][]
 * [Udacity k8s course][]
