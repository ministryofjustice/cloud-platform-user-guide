## Overview

The Ministry of Justice's Cloud Platform is a modern, cloud-native hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice.

The Cloud Platform provides a way for teams to:

- deploy a service or application into the cloud
- utilise common tooling, such as monitoring, logging, alerting, and security scanning of container images, without teams needing to configure or manage the infrastructure
- implement zero downtime deploys, scalability, and high availability of services

The Cloud Platform team manage the cloud infrastructure that services run on, including common tooling infrastructure.

## What can I host on the Cloud Platform?

The Cloud Platform supports services and applications that:

- run in Linux-based containers
- are secure by default (i.e. up-to-date and follow MOJ's [Security Guidance](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/))
- want to use backing services from Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon RDS or Amazon Simple Queue Service
- follow the [Twelve-Factor app method](https://12factor.net/) (specifically, [stateless](https://12factor.net/processes) and [disposable](https://12factor.net/disposability))
- don't require Public Services Network (PSN) connectivity
- are not classified as **Secret** or **Top Secret** (see below for more information)

The current implementation of Cloud Platform uses [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for container management and runs on Amazon Web Services.

## What is the highest security classification I can host on the Cloud Platform?

The Ministry of Justice follows the UK government's [Government Security Classification system](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/government-classification-scheme/#government-classification-scheme).

The Cloud Platform can host services up to, but not including, **Secret** within the Government Security Classification system.

If you need formal assurance that your service can be hosted on the Cloud Platform, you should [contact the MOJ's security team](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/#security-team-asking-for-help).
