## Overview

The Ministry of Justice's Cloud Platform is a modern, cloud-native hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice.

The Cloud Platform provides a way for teams to:

- deploy a service or application into the cloud
- utilise common tooling, such as monitoring, logging, alerting, and security scanning of container images, without teams needing to configure or manage the infrastructure
- implement zero downtime deploys, scalability, and high availability of services

The Cloud Platform team manage the cloud infrastructure that services run on, including common tooling infrastructure.

## What can I host on the Cloud Platform?

The Cloud Platform supports services and applications that:

- run in Linux-based containers
- are secure by default (i.e. up-to-date and follow MOJ's [Security Guidance](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/))
- want to use backing services from Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon RDS or Amazon Simple Queue Service
- follow the [Twelve-Factor app method](https://12factor.net/) (specifically, [stateless](https://12factor.net/processes) and [disposable](https://12factor.net/disposability))
- don't require Public Services Network (PSN) connectivity
- are not classified as **Secret** or **Top Secret** (see below for more information)

The current implementation of Cloud Platform uses [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for container management and runs on Amazon Web Services.

## What is the highest security classification I can host on the Cloud Platform?

The Ministry of Justice follows the UK government's [Government Security Classification system](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/government-classification-scheme/#government-classification-scheme).

The Cloud Platform can host services up to, but not including, **Secret** within the Government Security Classification system.

If you need formal assurance that your service can be hosted on the Cloud Platform, you should [contact the MOJ's security team](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/user-guide/#security-team-asking-for-help).

## Shared Responsibility

The responsibility for the Cloud Platform and services hosted on it, is shared between the Cloud Platform team and the service teams.

In general the Cloud Platform team is responsible for the platform infrastructure, for example the Kubernetes cluster, networking, and provided tooling such as Terraform modules or infrastructure deployment pipelines.

The service teams are responsible for the services they run on the platform, including application code, configuration, and resources created in the Environments repository.

## Data Responsibility

Data held by the Cloud Platform about the services it hosts, eg service names, slack channels, infrastructure metadata, is the responsibility of the Cloud Platform team.

Data held in databases or filesystems by services hosted on the Cloud Platform is the responsibility of the service teams.
