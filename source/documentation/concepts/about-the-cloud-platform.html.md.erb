The MoJ Cloud Platform is a modern hosting platform for digital services:

- It makes it quick and easy to 'just deploy an app'
- Teams get the features they need to operate their service, such as
  easy scalability, zero downtime deploys, security scanning,
  monitoring, logging, and more, all setup for you by default
- When you need the full power of AWS or Kubernetes, it's all available
- Configuration is all self-service, using Infrastructure as Code with
  managed CI/CD and GitOps processes
- The Cloud Platform team manage the hosting and provide support for
  the platform
