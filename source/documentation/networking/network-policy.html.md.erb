# Overview

Network Policies are used to regulate connectivity between Kubernetes namespaces.
Every namespace in the cluster has network policies which only allow inbound traffic from the _ingress controllers_ namespace (so that incoming requests can be routed to your web applications).

A network policy allows connection based on `PodSelector` and/or `NamespaceSelector`.  The policy will then filter requests based on namespace or pod labels.

## Namespace Label

This example demonstrates using a `namespaceSelector` to route traffic based on a namespace label.

Any namespace label can be used in the network policy.
For clarity, and to avoid overlap with other namespaces, let's make our label key:
   `cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace`


```
# 00-namepace.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: source-namespace
  labels:
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace: "source-namespace"  # this is the label
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/is-production: "false"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/environment-name: "dev"
  annotations:
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/business-unit: "HMPPS"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/application: "court-probation"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/owner: "andy.marke@digital.justice.gov.uk: andy.marke@digital.justice.gov.uk"
    cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/source-code: "https://github.com/ministryofjustice/court-probation-service"
```

##  Network Policy

Once the relevant label has been added to the namespace, the policy can be created.

The policy below allows all traffic from namespaces which have a label called `cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace` with the the value `source-namespace` to route to the namespace called `target-namespace`.

```
# 04-networkpolicy.yaml
# allow-source-namespace.yaml
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-source-namespace
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/namespace: "source-namespace'

```

Note: For more complex use-cases, or if the policy is going to be specific to a Pod, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors)

## Accessing the service

To access a service in the target namespace **from the source namespace** we need to add the target namespace name to the domain name of the service, e.g:

```
curl myservice.target-namespace
```

## Cross Namespace Network Access
The following user guide demostrates how cross namespace network access works. The advised option is to use a service and network policy to communicate within the cluster.

Using a service and specifying a NetworkPolicy that allows Ingress from the source namespace allows a connection directly on an internal IP without going via the Nginx reverse proxy in front. This increases throughput and reduces latency, with the caveat that logs will not be visible in the ingress OpenSearch index, only in the cluster (pod) logs.

To do this, begin by adding a NetworkPolicy to `04-networkpolicy.yaml` in the source namespace

Example:

```
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-token-verification-api-dev
  namespace: example-dev
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              component: token-verification-api-dev // This should match the namespace label
```

To also allow this change to work within the `00-namespace.yaml`, a label will need to be added for component. This needs to match what is in the component in the matchLabels section on the NetworkPolicy

Example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    component: token-verification-api-dev // This should match the component in the NetworkPolicy
```
