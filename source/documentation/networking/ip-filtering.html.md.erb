### Inbound IP Filtering

Allowed client IP source ranges can be specified using the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range annotation. The value is a comma separated list of CIDRs, e.g. 1.1.1.1/24,10.0.0.0/24.

[Kubernetes official documentation on allowing source ranges][kubernetes-annotations-whitelist-source-range].

[kubernetes-annotations-whitelist-source-range]: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#whitelist-source-range

An example configuration using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: 1.1.1.1/24,10.0.0.0/24`

   ```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: <ingress-name>
  namespace: <namespace-name>
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: 1.1.1.1/24,10.0.0.0/24
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/set-identifier: <ingress-name>-<namespace-name>-<colour>
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-weight: "100"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-03-21T14:26:31Z
  generation: 1
spec:
  ingressClassName: default
  rules:
  - host: my-app.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
          backend:
            service:
              name: <my-svc>
              port:
                number: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - my-app.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - hostname: <hostname>
   ```
(Note - Please change the `ingress-name` and `namespace-name` values in the above example. The `colour` should be `green` for ingress in EKS `live` cluster)

Testing with the annotation set:

```
curl -v -H "Host: my-app.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk" <HOST-IP>
```
Will return a "403 forbidden" status

#### IP6 / IPv6

Currently, IPv6 is not supported for inbound IP filtering.

It should be possible to add IPv6 support to the platform, but nobody has asked for this, so we haven't done it.

If this is something you need, please raise a [support ticket] explaining your need.

### Outbound IP filtering

> Please note that these numbers may change, and **should not be relied upon for authentication/authorisation**.

#### NAT Gateways

IP traffic from the Cloud Platform will originate from the IP numbers of one our NAT Gateways. We have one NAT Gateway in each of the three availability zones in which we host the Cloud Platform, and outbound traffic may originate from any of them.

Currently, these are the IPs from which traffic will appear to come:

##### Live Cluster

```
35.178.209.113
3.8.51.207
35.177.252.54
```

##### Changes

There is **no guarantee** that the origin IPs of traffic from the cloud platform will remain the same.

If we **plan** to change them (e.g. if we migrate to another kubernetes cluster), we will provide as much notice as possible, via posts in the `#cloud-platform-update` slack channel.

However, in the event of a catastrophic failure where we have to rebuild the platform from scratch (easier than it sounds, since everything is defined in source code), we will not be able to give any warning.
