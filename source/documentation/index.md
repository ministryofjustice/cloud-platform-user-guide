# Cloud platform user guide

## Using this guide

To the left, you will see the top-level navigation items.

* **Concepts**: High-level articles, e.g. "What is Kubernetes?"
* **Tasks**: Articles covering specific "how to" topics, e.g. "How to deploy an
  application"
* **Reference**: Information such as Cloud Platform processes, and links to
  external documentation resources
* **Getting Help**: How to get help if you can't find what you need in this
  guide

Click these to expand the corresponding section of the guide.

Currently, the vast majority of the information in the guide is in the "Tasks" section.

> Because of the way this guide is [published][tech-docs-template], each of the
> sections ends up as a single HTML page. Because of this, you might find
> Cmd-F/Ctrl-F on the "Tasks" page more useful than the search box in the upper
> left corner.

## Brand new to Kubernetes/The Cloud Platform?

The [Deploying a Hello World application] tutorial is a good place to start.

## Adding to the guide

If there's something missing, please either let us know and we'll add a new
article, or if you're comfortable writing one yourself, PRs will be gratefully
received. Details on how to get in touch are in the "Getting Help" section, and
the "GithHub" link at the top right will take you to the repository for this
guide.
