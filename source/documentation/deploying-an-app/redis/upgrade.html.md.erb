If you have a Redis cluster in the Cloud Platform, you must keep it up to date and use the most cost effective instance type for your needs.

AWS publishes an [ElastiCache for Redis end-of-life schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/deprecated-engine-versions.html) and [supported Redis versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/supported-engine-versions.html) guide to help you keep up to date.

## Upgrading a Redis version

>Note: This will cause some downtime (usually minutes, dependent on how much data is in your cluster).

To upgrade your Redis cluster version, complete these three steps:

1. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

2. Raise and merge a PR that updates the following attributes for your ElastiCache for Redis cluster, which is typically in `resources/elasticache.tf` in your namespace:

    ```hcl
    module "redis_cluster" {
      ...
      engine_version       = "7.0"
      parameter_group_name = "default.redis7"
      ...
    }
    ```

    These two attributes must match the version you are upgrading to. The table below shows the attribute pairs to use.

    As soon as this PR is merged, the upgrade will begin.

    #### Engine version and parameter groups

    | Version to upgrade to | engine_version | parameter_group_name |
    |-|-|-|
    | Redis 7.0 | `7.0` | `default.redis7` |

3. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` file added in step 1

### Upgrade paths

Redis aims to maintain backwards compatibility when releasing a new major version. This means that you can upgrade your Redis cluster through multiple major versions in one upgrade step.

For example, you can upgrade from ElastiCache for Redis `4.0.10` directly to ElastiCache for Redis `7.0`.

| Current Redis version | You should upgrade to |
|-|-|
| 4.0.x | 7.0 |
| 5.0.x | 7.0 |
| 6.0.x | 7.0 |
| 6.2.x | 7.0 |

## Changing your Redis instance type

>Note: This will cause some downtime (usually minutes, dependent on how much data is in your cluster).

To change your Redis instance type, complete these three steps:

1. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

2. Raise and merge a PR that updates the `node_type` attribute for your ElastiCache for Redis cluster, which is typically in `resources/elasticache.tf` in your namespace:

    ```hcl
    module "redis_cluster" {
      ...
      node_type = "cache.t4g.micro"
      ...
    }
    ```

    The [Creating a Redis cluster](/documentation/deploying-an-app/redis/create.html#table-of-instance-types) guide can help you decide which `node_type` to use.

    As soon as this PR is merged, the instance type change will begin.

3. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` file added in step 1
