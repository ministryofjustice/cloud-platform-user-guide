If you have an OpenSearch domain in the Cloud Platform, you should keep it up to date and use the most cost effective instance type for your needs.

AWS publishes a [Supported upgrade paths for Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html#supported-upgrade-paths) guide to help you keep up to date.

## Upgrading an OpenSearch version

>Note: This will cause some downtime (usually upwards of 60 minutes, dependent on how much data is in your domain - an empty domain takes 30 minutes).

To upgrade your OpenSearch domain version, complete these three steps:

1. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

2. Raise and merge a PR that updates the following attributes for your OpenSearch domain, which is typically in `resources/opensearch.tf` in your namespace:

    ```hcl
    module "opensearch" {
      ...
      engine_version = "OpenSearch_1.3"
      ...
    }
    ```

    As soon as this PR is merged, the upgrade will begin.

3. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` added in step 1

### Upgrade paths

OpenSearch does not always maintain backwards compatibility when releasing a new major version. This means you need to check for any breaking changes in the version you are upgrading to.

You should read the AWS documentation on [Supported upgrade paths for OpenSearch domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/version-migration.html#supported-upgrade-paths) to understand how to upgrade your domain to the latest OpenSearch version, including any breaking changes.

## Changing your OpenSearch instance types

>Note: This will cause some downtime (usually upwards of 30 minutes, dependent on how much data is in your domain - an empty domain takes 15 minutes).

To change your OpenSearch instance types, complete these three steps:

1. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

2. Raise and merge a PR that updates the `instance_type`, `dedicated_master_type` or `warm_type` attributes for your OpenSearch domain, which is typically in `resources/opensearch.tf` in your namespace:

    ```hcl
    module "opensearch" {
      ...
      cluster_config = {
        # instance type
        ...
        instance_type = "m6g.large.search"
        ...

        # or dedicated primary nodes
        ...
        dedicated_master_type "m6g.large.search"
        ...

        # or warm nodes
        ...
        warm_type = "ultrawarm1.medium.search"
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ```

    The [Creating an OpenSearch domain](/documentation/deploying-an-app/opensearch/create.html) guide can help you decide which `cluster_config` to use. You should note that if your instance type is of the `t3` class, you cannot use dedicated primary nodes or warm nodes.

    As soon as this PR is merged, the instance type change will begin.

3. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` file added in step 1
