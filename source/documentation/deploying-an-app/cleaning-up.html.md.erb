When you have finished with a namespace, please clean it up (i.e. remove it).

This helps to keep the cloud platform repositories well-organised, and speeds
up deployments and changes to the cluster (because the build process doesn't
have to spend time managing unnecessary resources). It also deletes the
associated AWS resources, and helps to keep our hosting costs down.

## Preparation

If you have any ECR resources in your namespace which still contain images,  Concourse 
will fail when trying to delete the registry. You can either delete the images manually, 
or prepare the ECR for deletion by doing the following:

- Set the [`deletion_protection = false`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ecr-credentials/blob/main/examples/ecr.tf#L73-L78)
argument in your ECR module code.
- Raise a PR to apply this configuration change to your ECR resource.
- Merge the PR, and proceed with the namespace deletion process.

> IMPORTANT: It is **your responsibility as namespace/PR owner** to ensure that no other
environments depend upon access to your ECR resources.

To delete a namespace and all its associated AWS resources, simply raise a
[PR] which deletes the associated folder from the [cloud-platform-environments][envrepo].

So, if your namespace is called `mynamespace`, then you need to raise a [PR]
deleting the folder:

     namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/mynamespace

...and all its contents, from the [cloud-platform-environments][envrepo] repository.

Merging this [PR] will trigger the [destroy-deleted-namespaces Pipeline](/documentation/other-topics/concourse-pipelines.html),
which will delete all of your non production (with namespace annotation "cloud-platform.justice.gov.uk/is-production = false") namespace's AWS resources, followed by the
namespace itself. For production namespaces, the cloud-platform team will get an alert to manually delete the namespace.

> NB: If you have set up a CI/CD pipeline, which deploys into your namespace,
then this should be deleted first, so that anything you delete later is not
immediately recreated by your build pipeline.
