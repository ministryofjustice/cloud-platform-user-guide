When you have finished with a namespace, please clean it up (i.e. remove it).

This helps to keep the cloud platform repositories well-organised, and speeds
up deployments and changes to the cluster (because the build process doesn't
have to spend time managing unnecessary resources). It also deletes the
associated AWS resources, and helps to keep our hosting costs down.

To delete a namespace and all its associated AWS resources, simply raise a
[PR] which deletes the associated folder from the [cloud-platform-environments][envrepo].

So, if your namespace is called `mynamespace`, then you need to raise a [PR]
deleting the folder:

     namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/mynamespace

...and all its contents, from the [cloud-platform-environments][envrepo].

Merging this [PR] will trigger an automated pipeline which will delete all of
your namespace's AWS resources, followed by the namespace itself.

> NB: If you have set up a CI/CD pipeline, which deploys into your namespace,
then this should be deleted first, so that anything you delete later is not
immediately recreated by your build pipeline.
