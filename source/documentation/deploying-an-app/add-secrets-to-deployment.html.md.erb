# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The aim of this guide is to walkthrough the process of adding a secret (in this example, AWS credentials) to a previously deployed application in the Cloud Platform.

> This article walks you through the process of creating a secret manually. In practice, many of the secrets you will use in your applications are created automatically (e.g. database credentials).

## Pre-requisites

This guide assumes the following:

* You have created a namespace. See [Creating a Cloud Platform Environment][env-create]
* You have deployed your application. See [Deploying an application to the Cloud-Platform][deploy-hello-world]
* Your application is running. See [Interacting with the application][interact-with-app]

## Configuring secrets

This article covers encoding values into kubernetes secret objects. 

See [kuberenetes using secrets as environment variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables) for detailed information on providing values from kubernetes secrets to pods.

Create your AWS Credentials access key (making a note of the aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key)

### Base64-encode your secret

In this example  aws_access_key_id is 'AKIAFTKSAW15HJLOGD'. Issue the following command to base64-encode:

```
echo -n 'AKIAFTKSAW15HJLOGD' | base64 -b0
```

This will return the encoded id 'QUtJQUZUS1NBVzE1SEpMT0dE'

In this example the aws_secret_access_key is 'G8HJPMHVGFHK4547GFDSHHJJ'. Issue the following command to base64-encode:

```
echo -n 'G8HJPMHVGFHK4547GFDSHHJJ' | base64 -b0
```

This will return the encoded secret 'RzhISlBNSFZHRkhLNDU0N0dGRFNISEpK'

## Creating the secret

Create a secrets.yaml file similar to:

```Yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: demosecret
type: Opaque
data:
  aws_access_key_id: QUtJQUZUS1NBVzE1SEpMT0dE
  aws_secret_access_key: RzhISlBNSFZHRkhLNDU0N0dGRFNISEpK
```
issue the following command:

```
$ kubectl -n yournamespace apply -f secrets.yaml
secret "demosecret" created
```

To see the secrets:

```
$ kubectl -n yournamespace  get secrets
NAME                                          TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
default-token-hz7z7                           kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3         26d
demosecret                                    Opaque                                2         5d
```

Decoding the Secret
Secrets can be retrieved via the kubectl get secret command. For example, to retrieve the secret you created:

```
$ kubectl  -n yournamespace get secret demosecret  -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  aws_access_key_id: QUtJQUZUS1NBVzE1SEpMT0dE
  aws_secret_access_key: RzhISlBNSFZHRkhLNDU0N0dGRFNISEpK
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"v1","data":{"aws_access_key_id":"QUtJQUZUS1NBVzE1SEpMT0dE","aws_secret_access_key":"RzhISlBNSFZHRkhLNDU0N0dGRFNISEpK"},"kind":"Secret","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"demosecret","namespace":"yournamespace"},"type":"Opaque"}
  creationTimestamp: "2020-04-28T14:24:27Z"
  name: demosecret
  namespace: yournamespace
  resourceVersion: "239748077"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/dstest/secrets/demosecret
  uid: 5bd08c63-5f29-452f-a0ec-4d26404411e6
type: Opaque
```

## Using the secret in your applications

To use a secret you need to tell kubernetes to put its value in an environment variable which your application container can access. You will usually specify this in your application's `deployment.yaml` file.

The following example sets an `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable in the environment of the `django-demo-container`.

The value of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` comes from the secret called `demosecret` which is a hash with a key called `aws_access_key_id`, and the value of that key will become the value of the environment variable `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.

```Yaml
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: django-demo-container
          image: 754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud-platform-reference-app:django
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
          env:
            - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demosecret
                  key: aws_access_key_id
            - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demosecret
                  key: aws_secret_access_key
```

> When you reference a secret in this way, kubernetes takes care of the base64-decoding for you - you don't need to base64-decode the value in your code.
