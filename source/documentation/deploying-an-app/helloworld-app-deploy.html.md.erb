## Overview

The aim of this guide is to walkthrough the process of deploying an application into the Cloud Platform.

This guide uses a pre-configured ["Hello World" application][rubyapp-github] as an example of how to deploy your own. This application merely returns a static HTML response, and has no dependencies. Later examples will use more representative applications.

We will walk through these steps:

* Create a namespace (aka an "environment") on the Cloud Platform
* Deploy an instance of a pre-configured "Hello, World" application into your namespace

Then we will demonstrate a typical software development cycle of making and
deploying changes to the application:

* Create and authenticate to an [ECR]
* Make changes to the source code of the application
* Build a new docker image from the demo application
* Tag the image and push it to your ECR
* Update your kubernetes files to deploy the updated application

The process of building an image and pushing it to an ECR will normally be carried out by a build pipeline. For this initial walkthrough, we will go through these steps manually. Later we will go through an example of setting up a [CircleCI][circleci] job to do this automatically. The steps are similar if you're using other CI/CD tools such as [TravisCI][travisci].

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:

* [Docker][docker] is installed and configured.
* Kubectl is installed and configured (`brew install kubectl` on a Mac with [Homebrew][homebrew] installed, or [follow these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/))
* AWS CLI is installed (`brew install awscli` on a Mac with [Homebrew][homebrew] installed)
* You have installed the [Cloud Platform CLI]

## Step 1 - Create your namespace

Follow [this guide][env-create] to create a namespace on the Cloud Platform
(you don't need to do any of the "Next steps" from that guide).

## Step 2 - Deploy the "Hello, World" application

* Clone the [demo application](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby-app)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby-app
cd cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby-app
```

The application has a `kubectl_deploy` folder containing YAML files which
define an instance of the application for kubernetes.

Before we can deploy the application, we need to make some changes to run it in
your new namespace.

Edit your local copy of the `kubectl_deploy/ingress.yaml` file, and make the
following changes:

* Change the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation to the name of your namespace

This tells kubernetes that we want the ingress-controller belonging to your
namespace to handle traffic to your application. The ingress controller is
created by the `resources/ingress.tf` file which formed part of the PR you
raised to create your namespace.

* Change the hostname for the application

The current hostname for the demo application is:

```
helloworld-rubyapp.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

We need a unique domain name for this instance of the application. There is a
"wildcard" domain and SSL certificate available on the Cloud Platform, so we
will stick to a domain name which matches:

```
*.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Choose a domain name for your application and replace the two instances of
`helloworld-rubyapp` in the `kubectl_deploy/ingress.yaml` file with your chosen
name.

> If you want to use a domain name which doesn't match the default wildcard
domain, you will need to make some more changes. More information on this is
available [here][custom-domain-guide].

Once you have saved your changes to the `kubectl_deploy/ingress.yaml` file, you
can deploy the application using this command:

```
kubectl -n [namespace name] apply -f kubectl_deploy
```

This assumes that your current working directory is the root of your copy of
the helloworld application repository.

You can think of this command as meaning:

"Hey, kubernetes. Please apply all the YAML files in the `kubectl_deploy`
directory to the namespace called `my-namespace` (or whatever you called it)."

A few seconds later, you should be able to visit:

```
https://[your domain name].apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

...in your web browser, and see the "Hello, World!" message.

## The kubernetes YAML files

This is how the YAML files link together:

> You can find more deployment config info [in the kubernetes developer documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/).

### `ingress.yaml`

```Yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: mynamespace
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - helloworld-rubyapp.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
  rules:
  - host: helloworld-rubyapp.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: rubyapp-service
          servicePort: 4567
```

This tells the cluster that our ingress-controller (found by matching the
ingress class annotation to the name in the `resources/ingress.tf` file) should
accept web traffic to the hostname we defined, and should route that traffic to
port 4567 of the "service" called `rubyapp-service`.

### service.yaml

```Yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rubyapp-service
  labels:
    app: rubyapp-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 4567
    name: https
    targetPort: 4567
  selector:
    app: helloworld-rubyapp
```

This defines the service called `rubyapp-service` which listens on port 4567
and forwards web traffic to port 4567 of any pods whose `app` label is
`helloworld-rubyapp`.

### deployment.yaml

```Yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-rubyapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld-rubyapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld-rubyapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rubyapp
        image: ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 4567
```

This creates a single instance (`replicas: 1`) of a docker container based on
the docker image `ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby:1.1` (pulled
from https://hub.docker.com, since no other source is mentioned), which listens
on port 4567, and has the `app` label `helloworld-rubyapp`.

## Updating the application

To update our application, we need to:

* Change the application source code
* Create a new docker image from our updated code
* Push the image to a repository that kubernetes can access
* Update our `deployment.yaml` file with the new image details
* Apply the updated yaml file to kubernetes

## Step 3 - Create an Amazon ECR

Our initial deployment of the Hello World application pulls a docker image from
Docker Hub - a public docker image repository.

Most projects hosted on the Cloud Platform use Amazon ECR - a service providing
private docker image repositories, only accessible by a single team. So, we're
going to use an ECR to store our updated docker image.

Please follow [this guide][ecr-setup] to create an ECR for your namespace.

## Step 4 - Change the application code

Edit the `app.rb` file, and change "Hello, World!" to something else.

### Build the docker image

Now that we have updated the source code, we can build a new docker image
(locally).

```bash
docker build -t myimage .
```

> You can replace `myimage` with any name you like for your new docker image. Don't forget the `.` at the end of the command.

### Authenticating to your docker image repository

Before you can push the image to your ECR, you need to authenticate to it.

To authenticate to your ECR, you will need the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` which were created for you when you created your ECR. To retrieve these, see the [this section][access-ecr-credentials] of this guide.

*tl;dr* use this command:

      kubectl -n [namespace_name] get secret [name of your secret] -o yaml

Don't forget to base64 decode the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` values before using them.

You can pipe the yaml through [this script][decode-script] in order to decode the values, or you can do the following:

      echo 'your_access_key_id_value' | base64 --decode

Once you have your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`, set up an AWS profile using the AWS cli tool.

      aws configure --profile [namespace name]

You can call the profile anything you want.

Supply your credentials when prompted. For region, enter `eu-west-2` This is London, which is the region all cloud platform resources are in.

When prompted for `Default output format [None]:`, just press enter.

Now, tell the aws command-line tool to use these credentials by running:

    export AWS_PROFILE=[profile name]

Where `[profile name]` is whatever you entered for `--profile` in the `aws configure` command.

#### Login to the repository

The command to login to Amazon ECR is slightly different, depending on your version of the `aws` command-line tool. You can find this out by running:

      aws --version

For AWS version 1.x use the following command to login to Amazon ECR

      $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region eu-west-2)

> The output of the `aws ecr...` command is a long `docker login...` command. Including the `$(...)` around the command executes this output in the context of the current shell

For AWS version 2.0, use this command:

      aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 \
        | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
        754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

For either version of the aws cli, the output of the above should include `Login Succeeded` to confirm you have authenticated to the docker image repository.

These credential are valid for 12 hours. So, if you are working through this example over a longer period, you will have to login again, e.g. the following day.

### Tag the image and push it to your ECR

If you base64 decode the `repo_url` of the ECR secret in your namespace, you should get a value something like this:

```
754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-team/dstest-ecr
```

We need to tag our docker image with that URL in order to push it to our ECR.

> Amazon ECR uses the terms `repository` and `image` in a rather confusing way. Normally, you would think of a docker image repository as holding multiple images, each with a different name, where each image can have multiple tags. Amazon ECR conflates the repository and image - i.e. you can only push images with the same name to a given ECR.

> So, you can only push an image whose name matches your ECR's `repo_url` value. You are free to change the tag of the image, and some teams overload the tag value as a way to store multiple completely different docker images in a single ECR.

We need to tag the image you built earlier so it can be pushed to your ECR

      docker tag myimage 754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/[team_name]/[repo_name]:1.0

Replace `myimage` with whatever you chose in the `docker build` command, and use the `repo_url` value from your namespace secret.

Now we can push the image to your ECR:

    docker push 754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/[team_name]/[repo_name]:1.0

## Step 5 - Deploy the application

Now that we have a new docker image with our updated software, we can deploy it.

Edit your `kubectl_deploy/deployment.yaml` and change the `image` from
`ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helloworld-ruby:1.1` to the same value you
used in the `docker push` command above.

After saving your changes, apply them to the cluster by repeating the kubectl
apply command:

```
kubectl -n [namespace name] apply -f kubectl_deploy
```

This will cause kubernetes to launch a new pod using the new docker image, and
then delete the old one. In a few seconds, you should see your updated web
page.

> On a real project the process of building and tagging a new image, pushing it to the image repository and updating your deployment.yaml file is usually taken care of by a CI/CD pipeline. We've worked through this whole process manually here, to show how it all fits together.

## Add HTTP Basic Authentication

The application can be accessed from the internet at:

    https://[your domain name].apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk

As per the [guidance for domain names], our application should have some authentication to prevent citizens accidentally mistaking development websites for live government services. Whilst this isn't much of a problem with a 'hello world' site, it could be an issue for sites using the GDS prototype kit, which look exactly like live services. So, let's add [http basic authentication] to our application.

We can do this by amending our [Ingress], which is the kubernetes object that routes traffic to our application from the internet. We'll create an encrypted username and password, and then store that in a [kubernetes secret]. Then, we will update our Ingress to use basic authentication, and tell it where to find the credentials.

### Create the username and password

First we'll use the [htpasswd] program to create a one-way hashed username and password. htpasswd is a system program which should be pre-installed on your computer.

To create a username 'bob' with password 'password123' in a file called 'auth', run the following command:

```bash
$ htpasswd -cb auth bob password123
```

Whatever value you use for your password (which should *not* be 'password123' be sure to make a note of it now - it will not be visible again.

Kubernetes secrets are stored as base64-encoded text strings, so we need to run the 'auth' file through base64 (which should also be pre-installed):

```bash
$ cat auth | base64
```

This will output the string we need to store in our secret. For the purpose of this tutorial, I'm going to use `Ym9iOiRhcHIxJFVXQ1cxWDlvJGt3WDdoMTFZemNYdmVseHE2UFV2VzAK` Please substitute the value you got from the step above, using your own choice of username and password.

Note: only the hash of the password is stored in this string, not the password itself, so it is safe to store this string in a public github repository.

You can now delete the 'auth' file - we don't need it anymore.

### Create the kubernetes secret

Create a file called `kubectl_deploy/secret.yaml` containing the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: basic-auth
data:
  auth: Ym9iOiRhcHIxJFVXQ1cxWDlvJGt3WDdoMTFZemNYdmVseHE2UFV2VzAK
```

Remember to substitute your base64-encoded credentials string.

The next time we apply our yaml files to our namespace, this file will create a kubernetes secret called 'basic-auth'. Now we need to configure our Ingress to use it.

### Configure the Ingress

To configure our ingress to use basic authentication, we just need to add a couple of lines to the metadata section of `kubectl_deploy/ingress.yaml`

Replace this:

```yaml
...
metadata:
  name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: mynamespace
spec:
...
```

...with this:

```yaml
...
metadata:
  name: helloworld-rubyapp-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: mynamespace
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: basic-auth
spec:
...
```

This tells the Ingress what kind of authentication to use, and which kubernetes secret contains the credentials.

### Apply the changes

All that remains is to apply our updated yaml files in exactly the same way as we did before, when we deployed the application:

```
kubectl -n [namespace name] apply -f kubectl_deploy
```

You should see output like this:

```bash
deployment.apps/helloworld-rubyapp unchanged
ingress.networking.k8s.io/helloworld-rubyapp-ingress configured
secret "basic-auth" created
service "rubyapp-service" unchanged
```

Now, if you reload the browser page showing the 'Hello world' message from the application, you will be prompted to enter the username and password.
