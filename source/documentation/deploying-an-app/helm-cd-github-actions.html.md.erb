# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This tutorial walks through setting up continuous deployment of an application
using GitHub Actions and [Helm].

This builds on ideas in a previous tutorial, [Continuous Deployment of an
application using Github Actions][ga-cd]. If you haven't done so already,
please read that tutorial before working through this one.

## Pre-requisites

* A cloud platform [namespace] with...
* an [ECR],
* a [serviceaccount][create serviceaccount],
* and an [RDS] database
* [Helm] installed

## Multi-container Demo Application

We're going to deploy a copy of the [Cloud Platform Multi-container Demo
Application][multi-container].  Since you don't have write access to that
repository, we'll start by creating a new repository containing the same source
code.

> Github doesn't let you easily create a [fork] of a repository within the same
Github organisation

### Clone the current repository into a differently-named folder

```
git clone --depth 1 \
  git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-multi-container-demo-app \
  helm-cd-tutorial
```

> I'm using `helm-cd-tutorial` for this walkthrough. Please use a different
name for your copy, and use your repo name wherever you see `helm-cd-tutorial`
in the examples.

### Remove the connection to the original repository

```
cd helm-cd-tutorial
rm -rf .git
```

### Create a new GitHub repository

I'm using the [gh] GitHub command line tool. If you don't have it, you can do
this step via the GitHub web interface.

```
git init
git add *
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create --public ministryofjustice/helm-cd-tutorial
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

> Tip: make sure to run `gh config set git_protocol ssh` to use SSH rather than
HTTPS

### Create GitHub Actions Secrets

In your namespace folder in the [cloud-platform-environments] repository, raise a PR updating:

* `resources/ecr.tf`
* `resources/serviceaccount.tf`

Edit both files to tell the modules to create [GitHub Actions Secrets] in your
new repository:

```
  github_repositories = ["helm-cd-tutorial"]
```

Merge the PR as soon as it has been approved.

## Manual Helm Deployment

Before we automate the process, we'll go through it once manually.

The multi-container demo app. has a Helm chart already, but we need to change a
couple of things:

### Remove postgres container

We're using an RDS database instance for storage, so we don't need to deploy a
postgres container.

```
rm helm_deploy/multi-container-app/charts/postgresql-9.1.1.tgz
rm helm_deploy/multi-container-app/requirements.*
rm helm_deploy/multi-container-app/container-postgres-secrets.yaml
```

### Supply missing values

Edit `helm_deploy/multi-container-app/values.yaml`, and change this line:

```
databaseUrlSecretName: <DATABASE-URL-SECRET-NAME>
```

Replace `<DATABASE-URL-SECRET-NAME>` with the name of the secret in your
namespace that contains the `url` for your RDS instance.

By default this is `rds-instance-output` so this line should be:

```
databaseUrlSecretName: rds-instance-output
```

Next, you will see the line:

```
  - external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/set-identifier: <ingress-name>-<namespace-name>-green
```

We need to replace `<ingress-name>` with the name for our ingress - in the case of 
this demo application `multi-container-app`.

`<namespace-name>` will need to be replaced with the namespace which you are working within.

`green` here is the correct value for ingress in EKS `live` cluster so leave as it is.

A little further down in the same file, you should see these lines:

```
  hosts:
    - host: <DNS-PREFIX>.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

We need to replace `<DNS-PREFIX>` with a unique hostname for your instance of
this application.

I'm going to use `helm-cd` for this, but you should pick a different value.

```
  hosts:
    - host: helm-cd.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Commit and push your changes.

### Manual Helm Deploy

At this point you should be able to deploy the application like this:

```
cd helm_deploy/multi-container-app/
helm install myapplication . --values values.yaml --namespace <namespace-name>
```

Where `<namespace-name>` is the name of your cloud platform namespace.

You should see output like this:

```
NAME: myapplication
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Feb 12 16:16:05 2021
NAMESPACE: helm-cd-tutorial
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
...
```

To confirm that the app. is working, visit the URL corresponding to the
hostname you chose:

```
https://helm-cd.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

## Automating deployment

The steps we need our continuous deployment (CD) workflow to carry out are very
similar to those in the [github actions CD][ga-cd] tutorial. Whenever a change
is pushed to the `main` branch:

* Rebuild all of our docker images
* Tag them with a git SHA and push them to a docker image repository
* Update our Helm chart with the latest image tag
* `helm upgrade` our updated chart

## Rebuild docker images

The multi-container demo. app. has three components:

* rails-app
* content-api
* worker

For simplicity, we're going to build and push all three images whenever any
part of the code is updated. This means we can use the same git SHA throughout
our Helm chart, for all of our images. I'm also going to push all three images
to the same ECR.

Create a `.github/workflows/cd.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
name: Continuous Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build content-api image
        run: |
          cd content-api
          docker build -t content-api .
      - name: Push content-api to ECR
        uses: jwalton/gh-ecr-push@v1
        with:
          access-key-id: ${{ secrets.ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          region: eu-west-2
          local-image: content-api
          image: ${{ secrets.ECR_NAME }}:content-api-${{ github.sha }}
      - name: Build worker image
        run: |
          cd worker
          docker build -t worker .
      - name: Push worker to ECR
        uses: jwalton/gh-ecr-push@v1
        with:
          access-key-id: ${{ secrets.ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          region: eu-west-2
          local-image: worker
          image: ${{ secrets.ECR_NAME }}:worker-${{ github.sha }}
      - name: Build rails-app image
        run: |
          cd rails-app
          docker build -t rails-app .
      - name: Push rails-app to ECR
        uses: jwalton/gh-ecr-push@v1
        with:
          access-key-id: ${{ secrets.ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          region: eu-west-2
          local-image: rails-app
          image: ${{ secrets.ECR_NAME }}:rails-app-${{ github.sha }}
```

This builds all three component images of the multi-container demo application
in turn, and pushes each one to our ECR.

> A single AWS ECR represents a single docker image, so we are overriding the
tag value in order to store our three different docker images in a single ECR,
with the tags;
>
> * content-api-${{ github.sha }}
> * worker-${{ github.sha }}
> * rails-app-${{ github.sha }}

## Update the Helm Chart

We need to modify the Helm chart so that our CD workflow can provide the docker
image details at deployment time.

The only file which needs to change from one deployment to the next is the
`values.yaml` file. We'll turn that into a template, and supply the docker
image tag values via environment variables.

Rename the file;

```
mv helm_deploy/multi-container-app/values.yaml \
  helm_deploy/multi-container-app/values.tpl
```

Now, edit the file to replace the repository and image tag values. We need to change this:

```yaml
contentapi:
  replicaCount: 1
  image:
    repository: ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-multi-container-demo-app
    tag: content-api-1.6
```

...to this:

```yaml
contentapi:
  replicaCount: 1
  image:
    repository: ${ECR_URL}
    tag: content-api-${GITHUB_SHA}
```

Make the corresponding change for `railsapp` and `worker`:

```yaml
railsapp:
  replicaCount: 1
  image:
    repository: ${ECR_URL}
    tag: rails-app-${GITHUB_SHA}
```

```yaml
worker:
  replicaCount: 1
  image:
    repository: ${ECR_URL}
    tag: worker-${GITHUB_SHA}
```

Now, add a step to the end of `.github/workflows/cd.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: Update `values.yaml`
  run: |
    export GITHUB_SHA=${{ github.sha }}
    export ECR_URL=${{ secrets.ECR_URL }}
    cat helm_deploy/multi-container-app/values.tpl \
      | envsubst > helm_deploy/multi-container-app/values.yaml
```

## Authenticate to the cluster

Before we can use helm to apply the chart, we need to authenticate to the
cluster using the serviceaccount credentials.

This is identical to [this workflow step][ga-cd-authenticate] in the basic
[GitHub Actions CD][ga-cd] tutorial.

```yaml
- name: Authenticate to the cluster
  env:
    KUBE_CLUSTER: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CLUSTER }}
  run: |
    echo "${{ secrets.KUBE_CERT }}" > ca.crt
    kubectl config set-cluster ${KUBE_CLUSTER} --certificate-authority=./ca.crt --server=https://${KUBE_CLUSTER}
    kubectl config set-credentials deploy-user --token=${{ secrets.KUBE_TOKEN }}
    kubectl config set-context ${KUBE_CLUSTER} --cluster=${KUBE_CLUSTER} --user=deploy-user --namespace=${{ secrets.KUBE_NAMESPACE }}
    kubectl config use-context ${KUBE_CLUSTER}
```

## Helm Upgrade

Finally, add this step to perform the `helm upgrade`:

```yaml
- name: Upgrade the Helm chart
  run: |
    cd helm_deploy/multi-container-app/
    helm upgrade myapplication . \
      --values values.yaml \
      --namespace ${{ secrets.KUBE_NAMESPACE }}
```

> This command will only **upgrade** an existing Helm deployment, so you will need
to do a manual `helm install` at least once.

For reference, the full `.github/workflows/cd.yaml` and `helm_deploy/multi-container-app/values.tpl` files are in [this gist].

## Testing

Test your CD process by making a visible change, such as changing the `h1` text
in `rails-app/app/views/home/index.html.erb`

Commit and push your change, and shortly afterwards you should be able to
refresh your browser and see your change deployed live.

## Cleaning up

Please remember to [clean up] your namespace when you have finished
with it.
