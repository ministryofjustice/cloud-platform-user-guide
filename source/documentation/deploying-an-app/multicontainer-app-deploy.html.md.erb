## Overview

This section goes through the process of deploying a [demo application][multi-demo] consisting of several components, each running in its own container.

Please see the [application README][multi-demo-readme] for a description of the different components, and how they connect. You can also run the application locally via docker-compose to confirm that it works as it should.

## Running in the Kubernetes Cluster

In the [Cloud Platform][cloudplatform] kubernetes cluster, the application will be set up like this:

![Multi-container architecture diagram](/images/multi-container-k8s.png)

Each container needs a [Deployment][k8s-deployment] which will contain a [Pod][k8s-pod]. [Services][k8s-service] make pods available on the cluster's internal network, and an [Ingress][k8s-ingress] exposes one or more services to the outside world.

## Create an RDS instance

The application database will be an Amazon RDS instance. To create this, refer to the [cloud platform RDS][rds-module] repository, and create a terraform file in your sub-directory of the [cloud platform environments][cp-env] repository (you will need to raise a PR for this, and get the cloud platform team to approve it).

For more information see [Adding AWS resources to your environment][add-aws-resources].

The [demo application][multi-demo], and this guide, assumes a DATABASE_URL environment variable, exported by the terraform RDS module as follows:

    # rds.tf
    ...
    data {
      url = postgres://${module.module_name.database_username}:${module.module_name.database_password}@${module.module_name.rds_instance_endpoint}/${module.module_name.database_name}
    }
    ...

Please ensure that your `rds.tf` file exports a database `url` value in this way (changing `module_name` to match the name you use in your `rds.tf` file).

### Connecting to your RDS instance from your local machine

This is not required for this tutorial.

If you need to access an RDS instance from your local machine, you can find instructions for doing so [here][rds-access-instructions].

## Build docker images and pushing to ECR

As before, we need to build docker images which we will push to our [Amazon ECR][ecr].

Please carry out the following steps on your own working copy of the [demo application][multi-demo].

For `team_name` and `repo_name` please use the values from your `ecr.tf` file, when you [created your ECR][ecr-setup].

```
cd rails-app
docker build -t [team_name]/[repo_name]:rails-app .
docker tag [team_name]/[repo_name]:rails-app 754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/[team_name]/[repo_name]:rails-app-1.0
docker push 754256621582.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/[team_name]/[repo_name]:rails-app-1.0
```

Note that we are overloading the tag value to push multiple different containers to a single Amazon ECR. This is because of a quirk in the way Amazon ECR refers to `image repositories` and `images`.

Repeat the steps above for the `content-api` and `worker` sub-directories (changing `rails-app` as appropriate, in the commands).

The `makefile` in the [demo application][multi-demo] contains commands to make this process easier. Don't forget to edit the values for `TEAM_NAME`, `REPO_NAME` and `VERSION` appropriately.

## Kubernetes configuration

As per the diagram, we need to configure six objects in kubernetes - 3 deployments, 2 services and 1 ingress.

You can see these YAML config files in the `kubernetes_deploy` directory of the [demo application][multi-demo].

> Note: The yaml files in the github repository refer to docker images from docker hub, e.g. `ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-multi-container-demo-app:worker-1.4` These will work, but in order to deploy the docker images you built in the earlier step, please change this to the full reference to your docker images.

You also need to change the `host` entry in the `ingress.yaml` file, so that this instance of the application has a unique hostname (i.e. change `multi-container-demo.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk` to something like `[yourname]-demo.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`)

In `rails-app-deployment.yaml` and `worker-deployment.yaml` you can see the configuration for two environment variables:

* `DATABASE_URL` is retrieved from the kubernetes secret which was created when the RDS instance was set up
* `CONTENT_API_URL` uses the name and port defined in `content-api-service.yaml`

## Deploying to the cluster

After you have built and pushed your docker images, and made the corresponding changes to the `kubernetes_deploy/*.yaml` files, you can apply the configuration to your namespace in the kubernetes cluster:

      kubectl apply --filename kubernetes_deploy --namespace [your namespace]

## Interacting with the application

You should be able to view the application in your browser at:

      https://multi-container-demo.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/

It should behave in the same way as when you were running it locally via docker-compose.

## Further Development

After you deployed and Interacting with multi-container application and would like to create Monitoring dashboard and Custom Alerts for your application use this working examples:

* **Grafana dashboard** - Follow the [guide][creating-dashboards] on how to create a Grafana dashboard, make corresponding changes to [monitoring-grafana-dashboard.yaml][dashboard-configmap] file and apply the configmap to your namespace in the kubernetes cluster, which will show your Grafana-Dashboard [here][Dashboard].     

      ```
      kubectl apply --filename monitoring-grafana-dashboard.yaml --namespace [your namespace]
      ```

* **Custom Alerts** - Follow the [guide][custom-alert] on how to create Custom Alerts, make corresponding changes to [prometheus-app-alert.yaml][alert-prometheusrule] file and apply the PrometheusRule to your namespace in the kubernetes cluster, this will create custom alerts for your application.
      
      ```
      kubectl apply --filename prometheus-app-alert.yaml --namespace [your namespace]
      ```
