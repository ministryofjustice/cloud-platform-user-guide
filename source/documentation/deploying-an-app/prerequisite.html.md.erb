We use two [Pod Security Policies][psp] in the Cloud Platform, _restricted_ and _privileged_.

By default, any new environment/namespace on Live-1 will be assigned the
_restricted_ policy

### Impact

The main impact of the _restricted_ policy is that it prevents pods/containers
from running as the root user. 

A container's user is usually defined in its
Dockerfile. If no user is explicitly specified in the Dockerfile, the chances
are that it will run as root.

> Not being able to use root also implies that
> it is impossible to bind to a privileged port (e.g. 80, 443).

The policies only take effect after the container has started. Anything in the
Dockerfile can be run as root at image build time e.g. to install required
software.

### How to adapt to the pod security policies

Most of the time, your application's Dockerfile can be easily adapted by:

 - Creating a user with a UID which is greater than 1 (which is the UID
   reserved for root)

 - Giving this user any required permissions to access the files/directories
   the application requires.

 - Adding a `USER` clause in your Dockerfile to switch to your non-root user

Example:

```yaml
FROM busybox

RUN mkdir -p /opt/myFolder && \
    adduser --disabled-password myNewUser -u 1001 && \
    chown -R myNewUser:myNewUser /opt/myFolder

USER 1001

CMD myApplication
```

Depending on the base image, you might also need to explicitly create a group
for the user. In the busybox example above, a 'myNewUser' group is implicitly
created by the adduser command.

> **You must specify the user by its numeric UID**, as above, not by its
> username.  If you use the username (`USER myNewUser`) then the pod security
> policy will not be able to tell that that is a non-root user, and your
> container will not be scheduled.

#### Adapting the NGINX image

Since NGINX binds itself to a privileged port by default, it will not be able
to run as-is with the _restricted_ policy.

The cloud-platform team will update this page with relevant documentation
regarding nginx, as soon as it is ready.  In the meantime, feel free to reach
