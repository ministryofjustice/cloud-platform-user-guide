If you have a relational database in the Cloud Platform, you should keep it up to date and use the most cost effective instance type for your needs.

AWS publishes an end-of-life schedule for major and minor versions of [PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/PostgreSQLReleaseNotes/postgresql-release-calendar.html), [MariaDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html), and [MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html) to help you keep your database up to date.

## Things to note before upgrading a database version or changing the instance type

>A minor database version upgrade, a major database version upgrade, or changing your database instance type **will always** cause downtime.

>There is no rule of thumb to work out how long it will take, but tests show an empty database using a `db.t4g.micro` will take around 10 minutes.

## Upgrading to a new minor database version

>Note: This will cause downtime. See [Things to note before upgrading your database](#things-to-note-before-upgrading-a-database-version-or-changing-the-instance-type).

To upgrade your minor database version, complete these three steps:

1. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

2. Raise and merge a PR that updates the following attribute for your database, which is typically in `resources/rds.tf` in your namespace:

    ```hcl
    module "rds" {
      ...
      db_engine_version = "14.7" # the appropriate new minor version
      ...
    }
    ```

    As soon as this PR is merged, the upgrade will begin.

3. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` added in step 1

### Upgrade paths

You should refer to the end-of-life schedule for major and minor versions for [PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/PostgreSQLReleaseNotes/postgresql-release-calendar.html), [MariaDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html), and [MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html) to understand your upgrade paths. Typically, you will be able to upgrade to the latest minor version available on RDS.

## Upgrading to a new major database version

>Note: This will cause downtime. See [Things to note before upgrading your database](#things-to-note-before-upgrading-a-database-version-or-changing-the-instance-type).
>
>Note: If you need to upgrade major versions more than once, e.g. from Postgres 11 to 14, and then 14 to 15, you **must** turn off `prepare_for_major_upgrade` (step 6) after each upgrade and then turn it back on (step 5). Otherwise, any upgrade after the first will fail.

To upgrade your major database version, complete these eight steps:

1. Find your current database version and instance type

    In your namespace, find your database configuration and note the value for these four attributes:

    ```hcl
    module "rds" {
      ...
      db_engine         = "xyz"    # your database engine
      db_engine_version = "x.x.x"  # your current database engine version
      db_instance_class = "db.x.x" # your current database instance type
      rds_family        = "xyzx.x" # your current parameter group version
      ...
    }
    ```

2. Understand your major version upgrade paths from your current `db_engine_version` by reading [Upgrade paths for major version upgrades](/documentation/deploying-an-app/relational-databases/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-a-new-major-database-version-upgrade-paths)

3. Check if your current **and** new major database version supports the instance type you're currently using by reading [Supported DB engines for DB instance classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#Concepts.DBInstanceClass.Support)

    If not, follow the [Changing your database instance type](/documentation/deploying-an-app/relational-databases/upgrade.html#changing-your-database-instance-type) guide first to change your instance class to one that is supported by your current and new major database version. You **must** change your instance type **before** attempting to upgrade, otherwise it will fail.

    If you are unsure which instance type to choose, the [Creating a relational database](/documentation/deploying-an-app/relational-databases/create.html#table-of-instance-types) guide can help you choose what instance type to use based on your **current** version.

4. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

5. Raise and merge a PR that updates the `prepare_for_major_upgrade`, `db_engine`, `db_engine_version` and `rds_family` attributes to your **new** major version:

    ```hcl
    module "rds" {
      ...
      prepare_for_major_upgrade = true
      db_engine                 = "postgres"
      db_engine_version         = "14.7"
      rds_family                = "postgres14"
      ...
    }
    ```

    As soon as this PR is merged, the major version upgrade will begin.

6. Once the major version upgrade has finished, raise and merge a PR that turns off the `prepare_for_major_upgrade` attribute that was turned on in step 5:

    ```hcl
    module "rds" {
      ...
      prepare_for_major_upgrade = false
      ...
    }
    ```

    If you have a read replica of your database, you will also need to update the `db_engine_version` and `rds_family` attributes to your **new** major version after the upgrade of your primary database has finished:

    ```hcl
    module "read_replica" {
      ...
      db_engine_version = "14" # you shouldn't include the minor version here
      rds_family        = "postgres14"
      ...
    }
    ```

7. Optionally, as the major upgrade already has downtime, it might be worthwhile changing your database instance type to the latest generation supported by your **new** major version

8. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` file added in step 4

### Upgrade paths

You should refer to the major version upgrade paths for [PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.MajorVersion), [MariaDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.MariaDB.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.MariaDB.Major), and [MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.MySQL.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.MySQL.Major) to understand your upgrade paths from your current database engine version.

## Changing your database instance type

>Note: This will cause downtime. See [Things to note before upgrading your database](#things-to-note-before-upgrading-a-database-version-or-changing-the-instance-type).

To change your database instance type, complete these three steps:

1. Raise and merge a PR to tell the [apply pipeline to skip your namespace](/documentation/other-topics/long-running-env-operations.html#long-running-environments-operations)

2. Raise and merge a PR that updates the `db_instance_class` and `db_max_allocated_storage` attributes for your database, which are typically in `resources/rds.tf` in your namespace:

    ```hcl
    module "rds" {
      ...
      db_instance_class        = "db.t4g.micro"
      db_max_allocated_storage = "500" # maximum storage for autoscaling
      ...
    }
    ```

    The [Creating a relational database](/documentation/deploying-an-app/relational-databases/create.html#choosing-an-appropriate-instance-type) guide can help you decide which `db_instance_class` and `db_max_allocated_storage` values to use.

    As soon as this PR is merged, the instance type change will begin.

3. Raise and merge a PR to remove the `APPLY_PIPELINE_SKIP_THIS_NAMESPACE` file added in step 1
