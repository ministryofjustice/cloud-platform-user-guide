### Introduction

To build dashboards for your [CloudWatch][cloudwatch-metrics] metrics, you can use the [CloudWatch data source][CloudWatch-datasource].

#### Using the CloudWatch data source in Grafana 

There are some default dashboards [here][cp-dashboards], or you can build your own. You can also do dynamic queries using dimension wildcards.

Create a dashboard using CloudWatch data source:

From the official & community built [dashboards][default-dashboards], select the AWS resource for which you want to create the dashboard. Download it as JSON and modify it as you see fit. Copy the JSON string into a `ConfigMap` according to the example below.

```YAML
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <my-dashboard>
  namespace: <my-namespace>
  labels:
    grafana_dashboard: ""
data:
  my-dashboard.json: |
    {
      [ ... ]
    }
```

Add the `ConfigMap` above to your namespace folder in the [environments repo][env-repo]. Once the ConfigMap is applied though the concourse pipeline, your dashboard should be visible in Grafana shortly.

Dynamic queries using dimension wildcards:

Login to [Grafana][grafana-login] with your GitHub account. Select CloudWatch in Explore as shown in the picture below

Follow the guidance [here][dynamic-queries], to do dynamic queries using dimension wildcards.
