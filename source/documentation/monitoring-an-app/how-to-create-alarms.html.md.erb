### Overview
Alertmanager allows you define your own alert conditions based on [Prometheus expression language](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics) expressions.

The aim of this document is to provide you with the necessary information to create and send application specific alerts to a Slack channel of your choosing.

### Prerequisites
This guide assumes the following:

* You have [created a namespace for your application][env-create]

### Create a slack webhook and amend Alertmanager
1. Create a [slack webhook](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack) if you dont already have one for the channel you want to send the alerts.

2. Create a [kubernetes secret](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/deploying-an-app/add-secrets-to-deployment.html#adding-a-secret-to-an-application) to store the slack webhook. 

3. Create a ticket to request a new alert route in Alertmanager. The Cloud Platform team will need the following information:

- namespace name
- team name
- application name
- slack channel
- kubernetes secret name where the webhook url is stored
- severity level (warning/information)

If you want an event/information type slack message for monitoring non-problem/non-failure type events 
- e.g. a team wants to positively know something happened (like a database refresh, or app deployment etc), specify the severity level as `information`

The team will provide you with a "`custom severity level`" that'll need to be defined in the next step. Please copy it to your clipboard.

### Create a PrometheusRule
A `PrometheusRule` is a custom resource that defines your triggered alert. This file will contain the alert name, promql expression and time of check.

To create your own custom alert you'll need to fill in the template below and deploy it to your namespace (tip: you can check rules in your namespace by running `kubectl get prometheusrule -n <namespace>`).

- Create a file called `prometheus-custom-rules-<application_name>.yaml`
- Copy in the template below and replace the bracket values, specifying the requirements of your alert. The `<custom_severity_level>` field is the value you were passed earlier.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  namespace: <namespace>
  labels:
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-custom-rules-<application_name>
spec:
  groups:
  - name: application-rules
    rules:
    - alert: <alert_name>
      expr: <alert_query>
      for: <check_time_length>
      labels:
        severity: <custom_severity_level>
      annotations:
        message: <alert_message>
        runbook_url: <http://my-support-docs>
```
- Run `kubectl apply -f prometheus-custom-rules-<application_name>.yaml -n <namespace>`

A working example of this would be:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-custom-rules-my-application
spec:
  groups:
  - name: node.rules
    rules:
    - alert: Quota-Exceeded
      expr: 100 * kube_resourcequota{job="kube-state-metrics",type="used",namespace="monitoring"} / ignoring(instance, job, type) (kube_resourcequota{job="kube-state-metrics",type="hard"} > 0) > 90
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: cp-team
      annotations:
        message: Namespace {{ $labels.namespace }} is using {{ printf "%0.0f" $value}}% of its {{ $labels.resource }} quota.
        runbook_url: https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin/tree/master/runbook.md###alert-name-kubequotaexceeded
```

The `alert` name, `message` and `runbook_url` annotations will be sent to the Slack channel when the rule has been triggered.

For information type alerts, you can also add a label `status_icon: information` to have an information icon on the alert title.

You can view the applied rules with the following command:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> describe prometheusrules prometheus-custom-rules-<application_name>
```

### PrometheusRule examples
If you're struggling for ideas on how and which alerts to setup, please see some examples [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/master/terraform/cloud-platform-components/resources/prometheusrule-examples/application-alerts.yaml).

### Advisory Note 1: PrometheusRules status incase of DR/requirement for a new Prometheus Install

The  `PrometheusRule` is a [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/##customresourcedefinitions) that declaratively defines a desired Prometheus rule to be consumed by Prometheus and applied using a YAML file. However, if for any reason Prometheus has to be uninstalled, `all PrometheusRules are removed with the CRD.`

We recommend all PrometheusRules to be added to the [Environments Repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) within the namespace folder the rules refer to. This will ensure all rules are applied/present at all times.

PrometheusRules can still be tested/amended/applied manually, then a PR can be created to add to the Environments Repo when ready.

### Advisory Note 2: CPUThrottlingHigh Alert

The `CPUThrottlingHigh` alert is configured as part of the default rules when installing prometheus-operator. The alert can trigger when containers have low cpu limits, spiky workloads but very low average usage. CPU throttling can activate during those spikes. CPU usage is based on [CFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler).

If you think this may be causing an issue with your application, we recommend raising your CPU limit, whilst keeping the container CPU request as close to the 95%-ile average usage as possible.
