## Overview
[Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com) is a global performance and availability monitor for your web application. The aim of this document is to provide you with the necessary information to create Pingom checks via the [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) pipeline, and then send failing checks to a Slack channel of your choosing.

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes the following:

* You have [created a namespace for your application][env-create]
* You have a slack channel to send alerts to

## Create a Pingdom check
To create a Pingdom check simply add a `pingdom.tf` file in the resources directory of your namespace in your [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/master/namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) repository. You can define the conditions of your check using the resources outlined in the [Terraform community provider](https://github.com/russellcardullo/terraform-provider-pingdom). Here's a working example of a [basic check](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/master/namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/monitoring/resources).

```yaml
provider "pingdom" {
}

resource "pingdom_check" "claim-criminal-injuries-compensation-uat" {
  type                     = "http"
  name                     = "cica - uat - cloud-platform - claim"
  host                     = "uat.claim-criminal-injuries-compensation.service.justice.gov.uk"
  resolution               = 1
  notifywhenbackup         = true
  sendnotificationwhendown = 6
  notifyagainevery         = 0
  url                      = "/"
  encryption               = true
  port                     = 443
  tags                     = "businessunit_platforms,application_prometheus,component_healthcheck,isproduction_true,environment_uat,infrastructuresupport_platforms"
  probefilters             = "region:EU"
  publicreport             = "true"
}

```

**Note**: You'll need to include the `provider "pingdom"` and `terraform` blocks either in this file or in a `main.tf` file.

This basic check simply checks that the host/url (in this case; uat.claim-criminal-injuries-compensation.service.justice.gov.uk) returns a 200 every minute (resolution = 1 minute). When six (sendnotificationwhendown = 6) consecutive checks fail it triggers an alarm. As publicreport is set to true, you can view the status of your check by visiting the public status page - http://pingdom.service.dsd.io, where this check would appear with the name "cica - uat - cloud-platform - claim".

[This](https://github.com/russellcardullo/terraform-provider-pingdom#pingdom-check) page explains all the attributes used in the check.

All resources, including Pingdom checks **must** be tagged and adhere to the technical guidance outlined [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/technical-guidance/blob/master/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners.md). Ensure your check has appropriate tags before submitting a pull request.

Once reviewed and merged to master, the pipeline will create your check in the MoJ Pingdom account.

### Adding Slack notification
You can enable the option to send a failing alert to Slack via a webhook by simply adding Pingdom integration id. You need administrator permissions to manage the mojdt [Pingdom Slack](https://mojdt.slack.com/apps/A0F814AV7-pingdom?next_id=0) webhook and then [Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com) to create the integration id.

The Cloud Platform team can do this on your behalf. Create a ticket requesting a Pingdom integration id with the following information:

  - team name
  - application name
  - slack channel

The team will provide you with an integration id, following the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/blob/master/docs/creating-pingdom-webhook.md).

You can now add `integrationids` to your `pingdom.tf`. Appending the example above, your check will now appear as follows (assuming you were given 1000 as the integration id):

```yaml
provider "pingdom" {
}

resource "pingdom_check" "claim-criminal-injuries-compensation-uat" {
  type                     = "http"
  name                     = "cica - uat - cloud-platform - claim"
  host                     = "uat.claim-criminal-injuries-compensation.service.justice.gov.uk"
  resolution               = 1
  notifywhenbackup         = true
  sendnotificationwhendown = 6
  notifyagainevery         = 0
  url                      = "/"
  encryption               = true
  port                     = 443
  tags                     = "businessunit_platforms,application_prometheus,component_healthcheck,isproduction_true,environment_uat,infrastructuresupport_platforms"
  probefilters             = "region:EU"
  publicreport             = "true"
  integrationids           = [1000]
}
```
